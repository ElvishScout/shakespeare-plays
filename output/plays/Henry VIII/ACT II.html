This respite shook</p><p class="line">The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,</p><p class="line">Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble</p><p class="line">The region of my breast, which forced such way,</p><p class="line">That many mazed considerings did throng</p><p class="line">And press'd in with this caution. First, methought</p><p class="line">I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had</p><p class="line">Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,</p><p class="line">If it conceived a male child by me, should</p><p class="line">Do no more offices of life to't than</p><p class="line">The grave does to the dead, for her male issue</p><p class="line">Or died where they were made, or shortly after</p><p class="line">This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,</p><p class="line">This was a judgment on me, that my kingdom,</p><p class="line">Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not</p><p class="line">Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that</p><p class="line">I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in</p><p class="line">By this my issue's fail, and that gave to me</p><p class="line">Many a groaning throe.
