Art thou</p><p class="line">not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at</p><p class="line">it?</p><p class="player">PRINCE HENRY</p><p class="line">Not a whit, i' faith, I lack some of thy instinct.</p><p class="player">FALSTAFF</p><p class="line">Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou</p><p class="line">comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.</p><p class="player">PRINCE HENRY</p><p class="line">Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the</p><p class="line">particulars of my life.</p><p class="player">FALSTAFF</p><p class="line">Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,</p><p class="line">this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.</p><p class="player">PRINCE HENRY</p><p class="line">Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden</p><p class="line">sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich</p><p class="line">crown for a pitiful bald crown!</p><p class="player">FALSTAFF</p><p class="line">Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,</p><p class="line">now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to</p><p class="line">make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have</p><p class="line">wept, for I must speak in passion, and I will do it</p><p class="line">in King Cambyses' vein.</p><p class="player">PRINCE HENRY</p><p class="line">Well, here is my leg.</p><p class="player">FALSTAFF</p><p class="line">And here is my speech.

That thou art my son, I have</p><p class="line">partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,</p><p class="line">but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a</p><p class="line">foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant</p><p class="line">me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point,</p><p class="line">why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall</p><p class="line">the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat</p><p class="line">blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall</p><p class="line">the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a</p><p class="line">question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,</p><p class="line">which thou hast often heard of and it is known to</p><p class="line">many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,</p><p class="line">as ancient writers do report, doth defile, so doth</p><p class="line">the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not</p><p class="line">speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in</p><p class="line">pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in</p><p class="line">woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I</p><p class="line">have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.</p><p class="player">PRINCE HENRY</p><p class="line">What manner of man, an it like your majesty?</p><p class="player">FALSTAFF</p><p class="line">A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent, of a</p><p class="line">cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble</p><p class="line">carriage, and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,</p><p class="line">by'r lady, inclining to three score, and now I</p><p class="line">remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man</p><p class="line">should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me, for, Harry,</p><p class="line">I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be</p><p class="line">known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,</p><p class="line">peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that</p><p class="line">Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish.

If sack and sugar be a fault,</p><p class="line">God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a</p><p class="line">sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if</p><p class="line">to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine</p><p class="line">are to be loved.
