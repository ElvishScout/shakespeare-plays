stock:</p><p class="line">Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,</p><p class="line">Which here we waken to our country's good,</p><p class="line">This noble isle doth want her proper limbs,</p><p class="line">Her face defaced with scars of infamy,</p><p class="line">Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,</p><p class="line">And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf</p><p class="line">Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.</p><p class="line">Which to recure, we heartily solicit</p><p class="line">Your gracious self to take on you the charge</p><p class="line">And kingly government of this your land,</p><p class="line">Not as protector, steward, substitute,</p><p class="line">Or lowly factor for another's gain,</p><p class="line">But as successively from blood to blood,</p><p class="line">Your right of birth, your empery, your own.</p><p class="line">For this, consorted with the citizens,</p><p class="line">Your very worshipful and loving friends,</p><p class="line">And by their vehement instigation,</p><p class="line">In this just suit come I to move your grace.</p><p class="player">GLOUCESTER</p><p class="line">I know not whether to depart in silence,</p><p class="line">Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.</p><p class="line">Best fitteth my degree or your condition</p><p class="line">If not to answer, you might haply think</p><p class="line">Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded</p><p class="line">To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,</p><p class="line">Which fondly you would here impose on me,</p><p class="line">If to reprove you for this suit of yours,</p><p class="line">So season'd with your faithful love to me.</p><p class="line">Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.</p><p class="line">Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,</p><p class="line">And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,</p><p class="line">Definitively thus I answer you.</p><p class="line">Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert</p><p class="line">Unmeritable shuns your high request.</p><p class="line">First if all obstacles were cut away,</p><p class="line">And that my path were even to the crown,</p><p class="line">As my ripe revenue and due by birth</p><p class="line">Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,</p><p class="line">So mighty and so many my defects,</p><p class="line">As I had rather hide me from my greatness,</p><p class="line">Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,</p><p class="line">Than in my greatness covet to be hid,</p><p class="line">And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.</p><p class="line">But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,</p><p class="line">And much I need to help you, if need were,</p><p class="line">The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,</p><p class="line">Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,</p><p class="line">Will well become the seat of majesty,</p><p class="line">And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.</p><p class="line">On him I lay what you would lay on me,</p><p class="line">The right and fortune of his happy stars,</p><p class="line">Which God defend that I should wring from him!</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">My lord, this argues conscience in your grace,</p><p class="line">But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,</p><p class="line">All circumstances well considered.</p><p class="line">You say that Edward is your brother's son:</p><p class="line">So say we too, but not by Edward's wife,</p><p class="line">For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--</p><p class="line">Your mother lives a witness to that vow--</p><p class="line">And afterward by substitute betroth'd</p><p class="line">To Bona, sister to the King of France.</p><p class="line">These both put by a poor petitioner,</p><p class="line">A care-crazed mother of a many children,</p><p class="line">A beauty-waning and distressed widow,</p><p class="line">Even in the afternoon of her best days,</p><p class="line">Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,</p><p class="line">Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts</p><p class="line">To base declension and loathed bigamy</p><p class="line">By her, in his unlawful bed, he got</p><p class="line">This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.</p><p class="line">More bitterly could I expostulate,</p><p class="line">Save that, for reverence to some alive,</p><p class="line">I give a sparing limit to my tongue.</p><p class="line">Then, good my lord, take to your royal self</p><p class="line">This proffer'd benefit of dignity,</p><p class="line">If non to bless us and the land withal,</p><p class="line">Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry</p><p class="line">From the corruption of abusing times,</p><p class="line">Unto a lineal true-derived course.</p><p class="player">Lord Mayor</p><p class="line">Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p

class="line">Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?</p><p class="line">I am unfit for state and majesty,</p><p class="line">I do beseech you, take it not amiss,</p><p class="line">I cannot nor I will not yield to you.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,</p><p class="line">Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son,</p><p

the throne,</p><p class="line">To the disgrace and downfall of your house:</p><p class="line">And in this resolution here we leave you.--</p><p class="line">Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.</p><p class="player">GLOUCESTER</p><p class="line">O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.</p><p class="action">Exit BUCKINGHAM with the Citizens</p><p class="player">CATESBY</p><p class="line">Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.</p><p class="player">ANOTHER</p><p class="line">Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.</p><p class="player">GLOUCESTER</p><p class="line">Would you enforce me to a world of care?</p><p class="line">Well, call them again.
