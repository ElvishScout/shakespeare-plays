The brain may</p><p class="line">devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps</p><p class="line">o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the</p><p class="line">youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the</p><p class="line">cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to</p><p class="line">choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may</p><p class="line">neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I</p><p class="line">dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curbed</p><p class="line">by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,</p><p class="line">Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?</p><p class="player">NERISSA</p><p class="line">Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their</p><p class="line">death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,</p><p class="line">that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,</p><p class="line">silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning</p><p class="line">chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any</p><p class="line">rightly but one who shall rightly love.
