For, though I</p><p class="line">speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I</p><p class="line">am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the</p><p class="line">element shows to him as it doth to me, all his</p><p class="line">senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies</p><p class="line">laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man, and</p><p class="line">though his affections are higher mounted than ours,</p><p class="line">yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like</p><p class="line">wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we</p><p class="line">do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish</p><p class="line">as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess</p><p class="line">him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing</p><p class="line">it, should dishearten his army.</p><p class="player">BATES</p><p class="line">He may show what outward courage he will, but I</p><p class="line">believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish</p><p class="line">himself in Thames up to the neck, and so I would he</p><p class="line">were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:</p><p class="line">I think he would not wish himself any where but</p><p class="line">where he is.</p><p class="player">BATES</p><p class="line">Then I would he were here alone, so should he be</p><p class="line">sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here</p><p class="line">alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's</p><p class="line">minds: methinks I could not die any where so</p><p class="line">contented as in the king's company, his cause being</p><p class="line">just and his quarrel honourable.</p><p class="player">WILLIAMS</p><p class="line">That's more than we know.</p><p class="player">BATES</p><p class="line">Ay, or more than we should seek after, for we know</p><p class="line">enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if</p><p class="line">his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes</p><p class="line">the crime of it out of us.</p><p class="player">WILLIAMS</p><p class="line">But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath</p><p class="line">a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and</p><p class="line">arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join</p><p class="line">together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at</p><p class="line">such a place,' some swearing, some crying for a</p><p class="line">surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind</p><p class="line">them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their</p><p class="line">children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die</p><p class="line">well that die in a battle, for how can they</p><p class="line">charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their</p><p class="line">argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it</p><p class="line">will be a black matter for the king that led them to</p><p class="line">it, whom to disobey were against all proportion of</p><p class="line">subjection.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">So, if a son that is by his father sent about</p><p class="line">merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the</p><p class="line">imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be</p><p class="line">imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a</p><p class="line">servant, under his master's command transporting a</p><p class="line">sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in</p><p class="line">many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the</p><p class="line">business of the master the author of the servant's</p><p class="line">damnation: but this is not so: the king is not</p><p class="line">bound to answer the particular endings of his</p><p class="line">soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of</p><p class="line">his servant, for they purpose not their death, when</p><p class="line">they purpose their services. Besides, there is no</p><p class="line">king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to</p><p class="line">the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all</p><p class="line">unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them</p><p class="line">the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder,</p><p class="line">some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of</p><p class="line">perjury, some, making the wars their bulwark, that</p><p class="line">have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with</p><p class="line">pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have</p><p class="line">defeated the law and outrun native punishment,</p><p class="line">though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to</p><p class="line">fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance,</p><p class="line">so that here men are punished for before-breach of</p><p class="line">the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where</p><p class="line">they feared the death, they have borne life away,</p><p class="line">and where they would be safe, they perish: then if</p><p class="line">they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of</p><p class="line">their damnation than he was before guilty of those</p><p class="line">impieties for the which they are now visited. Every</p><p class="line">subject's duty is the king's, but every subject's</p><p class="line">soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in</p><p class="line">the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every</p><p class="line">mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death</p><p class="line">is to him advantage, or not dying, the time was</p><p class="line">blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:</p><p class="line">and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think</p><p class="line">that, making God so free an offer, He let him</p><p class="line">outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach</p><p class="line">others how they should prepare.</p><p class="player">WILLIAMS</p><p class="line">'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon</p><p class="line">his own head, the king is not to answer it.</p><p class="player">BATES</p><p class="line">But I do not desire he should answer for me, and</p><p class="line">yet I determine to fight lustily for him.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.</p><p class="player">WILLIAMS</p><p class="line">Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but</p><p class="line">when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we</p><p class="line">ne'er the wiser.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.</p><p class="player">WILLIAMS</p><p class="line">You pay him then.
