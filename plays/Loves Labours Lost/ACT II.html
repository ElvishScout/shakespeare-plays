The same.</p><p class="action">Enter the PRINCESS of France, ROSALINE, MARIA, KATHARINE, BOYET, Lords, and other Attendants</p><p class="player">BOYET</p><p class="line">Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:</p><p class="line">Consider who the king your father sends,</p><p class="line">To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:</p><p class="line">Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,</p><p class="line">To parley with the sole inheritor</p><p class="line">Of all perfections that a man may owe,</p><p class="line">Matchless Navarre, the plea of no less weight</p><p class="line">Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.</p><p class="line">Be now as prodigal of all dear grace</p><p class="line">As Nature was in making graces dear</p><p class="line">When she did starve the general world beside</p><p class="line">And prodigally gave them all to you.</p><p class="player">PRINCESS</p><p class="line">Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,</p><p class="line">Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:</p><p class="line">Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,</p><p class="line">Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:</p><p class="line">I am less proud to hear you tell my worth</p><p class="line">Than you much willing to be counted wise</p><p class="line">In spending your wit in the praise of mine.</p><p class="line">But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,</p><p class="line">You are not ignorant, all-telling fame</p><p class="line">Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,</p><p class="line">Till painful study shall outwear three years,</p><p class="line">No woman may approach his silent court:</p><p class="line">Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,</p><p class="line">Before we enter his forbidden gates,</p><p class="line">To know his pleasure, and in that behalf,</p><p class="line">Bold of your worthiness, we single you</p><p class="line">As our best-moving fair solicitor.</p><p class="line">Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,</p><p class="line">On serious business, craving quick dispatch,</p><p class="line">Importunes personal conference with his grace:</p><p class="line">Haste, signify so much, while we attend,</p><p class="line">Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.</p><p class="player">BOYET</p><p class="line">Proud of employment, willingly I go.</p><p class="player">PRINCESS</p><p class="line">All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.</p><p class="action">Exit BOYET</p><p class="line">Who are the votaries, my loving lords,</p><p class="line">That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?</p><p class="player">First Lord</p><p class="line">Lord Longaville is one.</p><p class="player">PRINCESS</p><p class="line">Know you the man?</p><p class="player">MARIA</p><p class="line">I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,</p><p class="line">Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir</p><p class="line">Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized</p><p class="line">In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:</p><p class="line">A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd,</p><p class="line">Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:</p><p class="line">Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.</p><p class="line">The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,</p><p class="line">If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,</p><p class="line">Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will,</p><p class="line">Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills</p><p class="line">It should none spare that come within his power.</p><p class="player">PRINCESS</p><p class="line">Some merry mocking lord, belike, is't so?</p><p class="player">MARIA</p><p class="line">They say so most that most his humours know.</p><p class="player">PRINCESS</p><p class="line">Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.</p><p class="line">Who are the rest?</p><p class="player">KATHARINE</p><p class="line">The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,</p><p class="line">Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:</p><p class="line">Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill,</p><p class="line">For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,</p><p class="line">And shape to win grace though he had no wit.</p><p class="line">I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once,</p><p class="line">And much too little of that good I saw</p><p class="line">Is my report to his great worthiness.</p><p class="player">ROSALINE</p><p class="line">Another of these students at that time</p><p class="line">Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.</p><p class="line">Biron they call him, but a merrier man,</p><p class="line">Within the limit of becoming mirth,</p><p class="line">I never spent an hour's talk withal:</p><p class="line">His eye begets occasion for his wit,</p><p class="line">For every object that the one doth catch</p><p class="line">The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,</p><p class="line">Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,</p><p class="line">Delivers in such apt and gracious words</p><p class="line">That aged ears play truant at his tales</p><p class="line">And younger hearings are quite ravished,</p><p class="line">So sweet and voluble is his discourse.</p><p class="player">PRINCESS</p><p class="line">God bless my ladies! are they all in love,</p><p class="line">That every one her own hath garnished</p><p class="line">With such bedecking ornaments of praise?</p><p class="player">First Lord</p><p class="line">Here comes Boyet.</p><p class="action">Re-enter BOYET</p><p class="player">PRINCESS</p><p class="line">Now, what admittance, lord?</p><p class="player">BOYET</p><p class="line">Navarre had notice of your fair approach,</p><p class="line">And he and his competitors in oath</p><p class="line">Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,</p><p class="line">Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:</p><p class="line">He rather means to lodge you in the field,</p><p class="line">Like one that comes here to besiege his court,</p><p class="line">Than seek a dispensation for his oath,</p><p class="line">To let you enter his unpeopled house.</p><p class="line">Here comes Navarre.</p><p class="action">Enter FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and Attendants</p><p class="player">FERDINAND</p><p class="line">Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.</p><p class="player">PRINCESS</p><p class="line">'Fair' I give you back again, and 'welcome' I have</p><p class="line">not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be</p><p class="line">yours, and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.</p><p class="player">FERDINAND</p><p class="line">You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.</p><p class="player">PRINCESS</p><p class="line">I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.</p><p class="player">FERDINAND</p><p class="line">Hear me, dear lady, I have sworn an oath.</p><p class="player">PRINCESS</p><p class="line">Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.</p><p class="player">FERDINAND</p><p class="line">Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.</p><p class="player">PRINCESS</p><p class="line">Why, will shall break it, will and nothing else.</p><p class="player">FERDINAND</p><p class="line">Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.</p><p class="player">PRINCESS</p><p class="line">Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,</p><p class="line">Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.</p><p class="line">I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:</p><p class="line">Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,</p><p class="line">And sin to break it.</p><p class="line">But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:</p><p class="line">To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.</p><p class="line">Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,</p><p class="line">And suddenly resolve me in my suit.</p><p class="player">FERDINAND</p><p class="line">Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.</p><p class="player">PRINCESS</p><p class="line">You will the sooner, that I were away,</p><p class="line">For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.</p><p class="player">BIRON</p><p class="line">Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?</p><p class="player">ROSALINE</p><p class="line">Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?</p><p class="player">BIRON</p><p class="line">I know you did.</p><p class="player">ROSALINE</p><p class="line">How needless was it then to ask the question!</p><p class="player">BIRON</p><p class="line">You must not be so quick.</p><p class="player">ROSALINE</p><p class="line">'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.</p><p class="player">BIRON</p><p class="line">Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.</p><p class="player">ROSALINE</p><p class="line">Not till it leave the rider in the mire.</p><p class="player">BIRON</p><p class="line">What time o' day?</p><p class="player">ROSALINE</p><p class="line">The hour that fools should ask.</p><p class="player">BIRON</p><p class="line">Now fair befall your mask!</p><p class="player">ROSALINE</p><p class="line">Fair fall the face it covers!</p><p class="player">BIRON</p><p class="line">And send you many lovers!</p><p class="player">ROSALINE</p><p class="line">Amen, so you be none.</p><p class="player">BIRON</p><p class="line">Nay, then will I be gone.</p><p class="player">FERDINAND</p><p class="line">Madam, your father here doth intimate</p><p class="line">The payment of a hundred thousand crowns,</p><p class="line">Being but the one half of an entire sum</p><p class="line">Disbursed by my father in his wars.</p><p class="line">But say that he or we, as neither have,</p><p class="line">Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid</p><p class="line">A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which,</p><p class="line">One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,</p><p class="line">Although not valued to the money's worth.</p><p class="line">If then the king your father will restore</p><p class="line">But that one half which is unsatisfied,</p><p class="line">We will give up our right in Aquitaine,</p><p class="line">And hold fair friendship with his majesty.</p><p class="line">But that, it seems, he little purposeth,</p><p class="line">For here he doth demand to have repaid</p><p class="line">A hundred thousand crowns, and not demands,</p><p class="line">On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,</p><p class="line">To have his title live in Aquitaine,</p><p class="line">Which we much rather had depart withal</p><p class="line">And have the money by our father lent</p><p class="line">Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.</p><p class="line">Dear Princess, were not his requests so far</p><p class="line">From reason's yielding, your fair self should make</p><p class="line">A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast</p><p class="line">And go well satisfied to France again.</p><p class="player">PRINCESS</p><p class="line">You do the king my father too much wrong</p><p class="line">And wrong the reputation of your name,</p><p class="line">In so unseeming to confess receipt</p><p class="line">Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.</p><p class="player">FERDINAND</p><p class="line">I do protest I never heard of it,</p><p class="line">And if you prove it, I'll repay it back</p><p class="line">Or yield up Aquitaine.</p><p class="player">PRINCESS</p><p class="line">We arrest your word.</p><p class="line">Boyet, you can produce acquittances</p><p class="line">For such a sum from special officers</p><p class="line">Of Charles his father.</p><p class="player">FERDINAND</p><p class="line">Satisfy me so.</p><p class="player">BOYET</p><p class="line">So please your grace, the packet is not come</p><p class="line">Where that and other specialties are bound:</p><p

unto.</p><p class="line">Meantime receive such welcome at my hand</p><p class="line">As honour without breach of honour may</p><p class="line">Make tender of to thy true worthiness:</p><p class="line">You may not come, fair princess, in my gates,</p><p class="line">But here without you shall be so received</p><p class="line">As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,</p><p

class="line">The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.</p><p class="player">DUMAIN</p><p class="line">A gallant lady.

I desire her name.</p><p class="player">BOYET</p><p class="line">She hath but one for herself, to desire that were a shame.</p><p class="player">LONGAVILLE</p><p class="line">Pray you, sir, whose

like an agate, with your print impress'd,</p><p class="line">Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:</p><p class="line">His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,</p><p class="line">Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be,</p><p class="line">All senses to that sense did make their repair,</p><p class="line">To feel only looking on fairest of fair:</p><p class="line">Methought
