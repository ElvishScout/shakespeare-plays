These five days have I</p><p class="line">hid me in these woods and durst not peep out, for</p><p class="line">all the country is laid for me, but now am I so</p><p class="line">hungry that if I might have a lease of my life for a</p><p class="line">thousand years I could stay no longer. Wherefore,</p><p class="line">on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden, to</p><p class="line">see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another</p><p class="line">while, which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach</p><p class="line">this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'</p><p class="line">was born to do me good: for many a time, but for a</p><p class="line">sallet, my brainpan had been cleft with a brown</p><p class="line">bill, and many a time, when I have been dry and</p><p class="line">bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a</p><p class="line">quart pot to drink in, and now the word 'sallet'</p><p class="line">must serve me to feed on.</p><p class="action">Enter IDEN</p><p class="player">IDEN</p><p class="line">Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court,</p><p class="line">And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?</p><p class="line">This small inheritance my father left me</p><p class="line">Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.</p><p class="line">I seek not to wax great by others' waning,</p><p class="line">Or gather wealth, I care not, with what envy:</p><p class="line">Sufficeth that I have maintains my state</p><p class="line">And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.</p><p class="player">CADE</p><p class="line">Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a</p><p class="line">stray, for entering his fee-simple without leave.</p><p class="line">Ah, villain, thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand</p><p class="line">crowns of the king carrying my head to him: but</p><p class="line">I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallow</p><p class="line">my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part.</p><p class="player">IDEN</p><p class="line">Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,</p><p class="line">I know thee not, why, then, should I betray thee?</p><p class="line">Is't not enough to break into my garden,</p><p class="line">And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,</p><p class="line">Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,</p><p class="line">But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?</p><p class="player">CADE</p><p class="line">Brave thee! ay, by the best blood that ever was</p><p class="line">broached, and beard thee too.
