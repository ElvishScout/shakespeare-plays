Those that can pity, here</p><p class="line">May, if they think it well, let fall a tear,</p><p class="line">The subject will deserve it. Such as give</p><p class="line">Their money out of hope they may believe,</p><p class="line">May here find truth too. Those that come to see</p><p class="line">Only a show or two, and so agree</p><p class="line">The play may pass, if they be still and willing,</p><p class="line">I'll undertake may see away their shilling</p><p class="line">Richly in two short hours. Only they</p><p class="line">That come to hear a merry bawdy play,</p><p class="line">A noise of targets, or to see a fellow</p><p class="line">In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,</p><p class="line">Will be deceived, for, gentle hearers, know,</p><p class="line">To rank our chosen truth with such a show</p><p class="line">As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting</p><p class="line">Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,</p><p class="line">To make that only true we now intend,</p><p class="line">Will leave us never an understanding friend.</p><p class="line">Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known</p><p class="line">The first and happiest hearers of the town,</p><p class="line">Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see</p><p class="line">The very persons of our noble story</p><p class="line">As they were living, think you see them great,</p><p class="line">And follow'd with the general throng and sweat</p><p class="line">Of thousand friends, then in a moment, see</p><p class="line">How soon this mightiness meets misery:</p><p class="line">And, if you can be merry then, I'll say</p><p class="line">A man may weep upon his wedding-day.</p><p class="line">SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the palace.</p><p class="line">Enter NORFOLK at one door, at the other, BUCKINGHAM and ABERGAVENNY</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done</p><p class="line">Since last we saw in France?</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">I thank your grace,</p><p class="line">Healthful, and ever since a fresh admirer</p><p class="line">Of what I saw there.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">An untimely ague</p><p class="line">Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when</p><p class="line">Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,</p><p class="line">Met in the vale of Andren.</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">'Twixt Guynes and Arde:</p><p class="line">I was then present, saw them salute on horseback,</p><p class="line">Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung</p><p class="line">In their embracement, as they grew together,</p><p class="line">Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd</p><p class="line">Such a compounded one?</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">All the whole time</p><p class="line">I was my chamber's prisoner.</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">Then you lost</p><p class="line">The view of earthly glory: men might say,</p><p class="line">Till this time pomp was single, but now married</p><p class="line">To one above itself. Each following day</p><p class="line">Became the next day's master, till the last</p><p class="line">Made former wonders its. To-day the French,</p><p class="line">All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,</p><p class="line">Shone down the English, and, to-morrow, they</p><p class="line">Made Britain India: every man that stood</p><p class="line">Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were</p><p class="line">As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,</p><p class="line">Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear</p><p class="line">The pride upon them, that their very labour</p><p class="line">Was to them as a painting: now this masque</p><p class="line">Was cried incomparable, and the ensuing night</p><p class="line">Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,</p><p class="line">Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,</p><p class="line">As presence did present them, him in eye,</p><p class="line">Still him in praise: and, being present both</p><p class="line">'Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner</p><p class="line">Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--</p><p class="line">For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged</p><p class="line">The noble spirits to arms, they did perform</p><p class="line">Beyond thought's compass, that former fabulous story,</p><p class="line">Being now seen possible enough, got credit,</p><p class="line">That Bevis was believed.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">O, you go far.</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">As I belong to worship and affect</p><p class="line">In honour honesty, the tract of every thing</p><p class="line">Would by a good discourser lose some life,</p><p class="line">Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal,</p><p class="line">To the disposing of it nought rebell'd.</p><p class="line">Order gave each thing view, the office did</p><p class="line">Distinctly his full function.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">Who did guide,</p><p class="line">I mean, who set the body and the limbs</p><p class="line">Of this great sport together, as you guess?</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">One, certes, that promises no element</p><p class="line">In such a business.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">I pray you, who, my lord?</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">All this was order'd by the good discretion</p><p class="line">Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed</p><p class="line">From his ambitious finger. What had he</p><p class="line">To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder</p><p class="line">That such a keech can with his very bulk</p><p class="line">Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun</p><p class="line">And keep it from the earth.</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">Surely, sir,</p><p class="line">There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends,</p><p class="line">For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace</p><p class="line">Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon</p><p class="line">For high feats done to the crown, neither allied</p><p class="line">For eminent assistants, but, spider-like,</p><p class="line">Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,</p><p class="line">The force of his own merit makes his way</p><p class="line">A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys</p><p class="line">A place next to the king.</p><p class="player">ABERGAVENNY</p><p class="line">I cannot tell</p><p class="line">What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye</p><p class="line">Pierce into that, but I can see his pride</p><p class="line">Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,</p><p class="line">If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,</p><p class="line">Or has given all before, and he begins</p><p class="line">A new hell in himself.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">Why the devil,</p><p class="line">Upon this French going out, took he upon him,</p><p class="line">Without the privity o' the king, to appoint</p><p class="line">Who should attend on him? He makes up the file</p><p class="line">Of all the gentry, for the most part such</p><p class="line">To whom as great a charge as little honour</p><p class="line">He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,</p><p class="line">The honourable board of council out,</p><p class="line">Must fetch him in the papers.</p><p class="player">ABERGAVENNY</p><p class="line">I do know</p><p class="line">Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have</p><p class="line">By this so sickened their estates, that never</p><p class="line">They shall abound as formerly.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">O, many</p><p class="line">Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em</p><p class="line">For this great journey. What did this vanity</p><p class="line">But minister communication of</p><p class="line">A most poor issue?</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">Grievingly I think,</p><p class="line">The peace between the French and us not values</p><p class="line">The cost that did conclude it.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">Every man,</p><p class="line">After the hideous storm that follow'd, was</p><p class="line">A thing inspired, and, not consulting, broke</p><p class="line">Into a general prophecy, That this tempest,</p><p class="line">Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded</p><p class="line">The sudden breach on't.</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">Which is budded out,</p><p class="line">For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd</p><p class="line">Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.</p><p class="player">ABERGAVENNY</p><p class="line">Is it therefore</p><p class="line">The ambassador is silenced?</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">Marry, is't.</p><p class="player">ABERGAVENNY</p><p class="line">A proper title of a peace, and purchased</p><p class="line">At a superfluous rate!</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">Why, all this business</p><p class="line">Our reverend cardinal carried.</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">Like it your grace,</p><p class="line">The state takes notice of the private difference</p><p class="line">Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--</p><p class="line">And take it from a heart that wishes towards you</p><p class="line">Honour and plenteous safety--that you read</p><p class="line">The cardinal's malice and his potency</p><p class="line">Together, to consider further that</p><p class="line">What his high hatred would effect wants not</p><p class="line">A minister in his power. You know his nature,</p><p class="line">That he's revengeful, and I know his sword</p><p class="line">Hath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,</p><p class="line">It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,</p><p class="line">Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,</p><p class="line">You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock</p><p class="line">That I advise your shunning.</p><p class="line">Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before him,  certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries with  papers. CARDINAL WOLSEY in his passage fixeth his  eye on BUCKINGHAM, and BUCKINGHAM on him, both full of disdain</p><p class="player">CARDINAL WOLSEY</p><p class="line">The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?</p><p class="line">Where's his examination?</p><p class="player">First Secretary</p><p class="line">Here, so please you.</p><p class="player">CARDINAL WOLSEY</p><p class="line">Is he in person ready?</p><p class="player">First Secretary</p><p class="line">Ay, please your grace.</p><p class="player">CARDINAL WOLSEY</p><p class="line">Well, we shall then know more, and Buckingham</p><p class="line">Shall lessen this big look.</p><p class="line">Exeunt CARDINAL WOLSEY and his Train</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I</p><p class="line">Have not the power to muzzle him, therefore best</p><p class="line">Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book</p><p class="line">Outworths a noble's blood.</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">What, are you chafed?</p><p class="line">Ask God for temperance, that's the appliance only</p><p class="line">Which your disease requires.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">I read in's looks</p><p class="line">Matter against me, and his eye reviled</p><p class="line">Me, as his abject object: at this instant</p><p class="line">He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king,</p><p class="line">I'll follow and outstare him.</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">Stay, my lord,</p><p class="line">And let your reason with your choler question</p><p class="line">What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills</p><p class="line">Requires slow pace at first: anger is like</p><p class="line">A full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way,</p><p class="line">Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England</p><p class="line">Can advise me like you: be to yourself</p><p class="line">As you would to your friend.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">I'll to the king,</p><p class="line">And from a mouth of honour quite cry down</p><p class="line">This Ipswich fellow's insolence, or proclaim</p><p class="line">There's difference in no persons.</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">Be advised,</p><p class="line">Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot</p><p class="line">That it do singe yourself: we may outrun,</p><p class="line">By violent swiftness, that which we run at,</p><p class="line">And lose by over-running. Know you not,</p><p class="line">The fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er,</p><p class="line">In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised:</p><p class="line">I say again, there is no English soul</p><p class="line">More stronger to direct you than yourself,</p><p class="line">If with the sap of reason you would quench,</p><p class="line">Or but allay, the fire of passion.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">Sir,</p><p class="line">I am thankful to you, and I'll go along</p><p class="line">By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,</p><p class="line">Whom from the flow of gall I name not but</p><p class="line">From sincere motions, by intelligence,</p><p class="line">And proofs as clear as founts in July when</p><p class="line">We see each grain of gravel, I do know</p><p class="line">To be corrupt and treasonous.</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">Say not 'treasonous.'</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">To the king I'll say't, and make my vouch as strong</p><p class="line">As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,</p><p class="line">Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous</p><p class="line">As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief</p><p class="line">As able to perform't, his mind and place</p><p class="line">Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally--</p><p class="line">Only to show his pomp as well in France</p><p class="line">As here at home, suggests the king our master</p><p class="line">To this last costly treaty, the interview,</p><p class="line">That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass</p><p class="line">Did break i' the rinsing.</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">Faith, and so it did.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal</p><p class="line">The articles o' the combination drew</p><p class="line">As himself pleased, and they were ratified</p><p class="line">As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end</p><p class="line">As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal</p><p class="line">Has done this, and 'tis well, for worthy Wolsey,</p><p class="line">Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--</p><p class="line">Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy</p><p class="line">To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,</p><p class="line">Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--</p><p class="line">For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came</p><p class="line">To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:</p><p class="line">His fears were, that the interview betwixt</p><p class="line">England and France might, through their amity,</p><p class="line">Breed him some prejudice, for from this league</p><p class="line">Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily</p><p class="line">Deals with our cardinal, and, as I trow,--</p><p class="line">Which I do well, for I am sure the emperor</p><p class="line">Paid ere he promised, whereby his suit was granted</p><p class="line">Ere it was ask'd, but when the way was made,</p><p class="line">And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,</p><p class="line">That he would please to alter the king's course,</p><p class="line">And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,</p><p class="line">As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal</p><p class="line">Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,</p><p class="line">And for his own advantage.</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">I am sorry</p><p class="line">To hear this of him, and could wish he were</p><p class="line">Something mistaken in't.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">No, not a syllable:</p><p class="line">I  do pronounce him in that very shape</p><p class="line">He shall appear in proof.</p><p class="line">Enter BRANDON, a Sergeant-at-arms before him, and two or three of the Guard</p><p class="player">BRANDON</p><p class="line">Your office, sergeant, execute it.</p><p class="player">Sergeant</p><p class="line">Sir,</p><p class="line">My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl</p><p class="line">Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I</p><p class="line">Arrest thee of high treason, in the name</p><p class="line">Of our most sovereign king.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">Lo, you, my lord,</p><p class="line">The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish</p><p class="line">Under device and practise.</p><p class="player">BRANDON</p><p class="line">I am sorry</p><p class="line">To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on</p><p class="line">The business present: 'tis his highness' pleasure</p><p class="line">You shall to the Tower.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">It will help me nothing</p><p class="line">To plead mine innocence, for that dye is on me</p><p class="line">Which makes my whitest part black. The will of heaven</p><p class="line">Be done in this and all things! I obey.</p><p class="line">O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well!</p><p class="player">BRANDON</p><p class="line">Nay, he must bear you company. The king</p><p class="line">To ABERGAVENNY</p><p class="line">Is pleased you shall to the Tower, till you know</p><p class="line">How he determines further.</p><p class="player">ABERGAVENNY</p><p class="line">As the duke said,</p><p class="line">The will of heaven be done, and the king's pleasure</p><p class="line">By me obey'd!</p><p class="player">BRANDON</p><p class="line">Here is a warrant from</p><p class="line">The king to attach Lord Montacute, and the bodies</p><p class="line">Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car,</p><p class="line">One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor--</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">So, so,</p><p class="line">These are the limbs o' the plot: no more, I hope.</p><p class="player">BRANDON</p><p class="line">A monk o' the Chartreux.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">O, Nicholas Hopkins?</p><p class="player">BRANDON</p><p class="line">He.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">My surveyor is false, the o'er-great cardinal</p><p class="line">Hath show'd him gold, my life is spann'd already:</p><p class="line">I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,</p><p class="line">Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on,</p><p class="line">By darkening my clear sun. My lord, farewell.</p><p class="line">Exeunt</p><p class="line">SCENE II. The same. The council-chamber.</p><p class="line">Cornets. Enter KING HENRY VIII, leaning on  CARDINAL WOLSEY's shoulder, the Nobles, and LOVELL,  CARDINAL WOLSEY places himself under KING HENRY VIII's feet on his right side</p><p class="player">KING HENRY VIII</p><p class="line">My life itself, and the best heart of it,</p><p class="line">Thanks you for this great care: I stood i' the level</p><p class="line">Of a full-charged confederacy, and give thanks</p><p class="line">To you that choked it. Let be call'd before us</p><p class="line">That gentleman of Buckingham's, in person</p><p class="line">I'll hear him his confessions justify,</p><p class="line">And point by point the treasons of his master</p><p class="line">He shall again relate.</p><p class="line">A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!' Enter  QUEEN KATHARINE, ushered by NORFOLK, and SUFFOLK:  she kneels. KING HENRY VIII riseth from his state, takes her up, kisses and placeth her by him</p><p class="player">QUEEN KATHARINE</p><p class="line">Nay, we must longer kneel: I am a suitor.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY VIII</p><p class="line">Arise, and take place by us: half your suit</p><p class="line">Never name to us, you have half our power:</p><p class="line">The other moiety, ere you ask, is given,</p><p class="line">Repeat your will and take it.</p><p class="player">QUEEN KATHARINE</p><p class="line">Thank your majesty.</p><p class="line">That you would love yourself, and in that love</p><p class="line">Not unconsider'd leave your honour, nor</p><p class="line">The dignity of your office, is the point</p><p class="line">Of my petition.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY VIII</p><p class="line">Lady mine, proceed.</p><p class="player">QUEEN KATHARINE</p><p class="line">I am solicited, not by a few,</p><p class="line">And those of true condition, that your subjects</p><p class="line">Are in great grievance: there have been commissions</p><p class="line">Sent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart</p><p class="line">Of all their loyalties: wherein, although,</p><p class="line">My good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches</p><p class="line">Most bitterly on you, as putter on</p><p class="line">Of these exactions, yet the king our master--</p><p class="line">Whose honour heaven shield from soil!--even he</p><p class="line">escapes not</p><p class="line">Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks</p><p class="line">The sides of loyalty, and almost appears</p><p class="line">In loud rebellion.</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">Not almost appears,</p><p class="line">It doth appear, for, upon these taxations,</p><p class="line">The clothiers all, not able to maintain</p><p class="line">The many to them longing, have put off</p><p class="line">The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,</p><p class="line">Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger</p><p class="line">And lack of other means, in desperate manner</p><p class="line">Daring the event to the teeth, are all in uproar,</p><p class="line">And danger serves among then!</p><p class="player">KING HENRY VIII</p><p class="line">Taxation!</p><p class="line">Wherein? and what taxation? My lord cardinal,</p><p class="line">You that are blamed for it alike with us,</p><p class="line">Know you of this taxation?</p><p class="player">CARDINAL WOLSEY</p><p class="line">Please you, sir,</p><p class="line">I know but of a single part, in aught</p><p class="line">Pertains to the state, and front but in that file</p><p class="line">Where others tell steps with me.</p><p class="player">QUEEN KATHARINE</p><p class="line">No, my lord,</p><p class="line">You know no more than others, but you frame</p><p class="line">Things that are known alike, which are not wholesome</p><p class="line">To those which would not know them, and yet must</p><p class="line">Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,</p><p class="line">Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are</p><p class="line">Most pestilent to the bearing, and, to bear 'em,</p><p class="line">The back is sacrifice to the load. They say</p><p class="line">They are devised by you, or else you suffer</p><p class="line">Too hard an exclamation.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY VIII</p><p class="line">Still exaction!</p><p class="line">The nature of it? in what kind, let's know,</p><p class="line">Is this exaction?</p><p class="player">QUEEN KATHARINE</p><p class="line">I am much too venturous</p><p class="line">In tempting of your patience, but am bolden'd</p><p class="line">Under your promised pardon. The subjects' grief</p><p class="line">Comes through commissions, which compel from each</p><p class="line">The sixth part of his substance, to be levied</p><p class="line">Without delay, and the pretence for this</p><p class="line">Is named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:</p><p class="line">Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze</p><p class="line">Allegiance in them, their curses now</p><p class="line">Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,</p><p class="line">This tractable obedience is a slave</p><p class="line">To each incensed will. I would your highness</p><p class="line">Would give it quick consideration, for</p><p class="line">There is no primer business.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY VIII</p><p class="line">By my life,</p><p class="line">This is against our pleasure.</p><p class="player">CARDINAL WOLSEY</p><p class="line">And for me,</p><p class="line">I have no further gone in this than by</p><p class="line">A single voice, and that not pass'd me but</p><p class="line">By learned approbation of the judges. If I am</p><p class="line">Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know</p><p class="line">My faculties nor person, yet will be</p><p class="line">The chronicles of my doing, let me say</p><p class="line">'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake</p><p class="line">That virtue must go through. We must not stint</p><p class="line">Our necessary actions, in the fear</p><p class="line">To cope malicious censurers, which ever,</p><p class="line">As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow</p><p class="line">That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further</p><p class="line">Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,</p><p class="line">By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is</p><p class="line">Not ours, or not allow'd, what worst, as oft,</p><p class="line">Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up</p><p class="line">For our best act. If we shall stand still,</p><p class="line">In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,</p><p class="line">We should take root here where we sit, or sit</p><p class="line">State-statues only.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY VIII</p><p class="line">Things done well,</p><p class="line">And with a care, exempt themselves from fear,</p><p class="line">Things done without example, in their issue</p><p class="line">Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent</p><p class="line">Of this commission? I believe, not any.</p><p class="line">We must not rend our subjects from our laws,</p><p class="line">And stick them in our will.

Now, what moved me to't,</p><p class="line">I will be bold with time and your attention:</p><p class="line">Then mark the inducement. Thus it came, give heed to't:</p><p class="line">My conscience first received a tenderness,</p><p class="line">Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd</p><p class="line">By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador,</p><p class="line">Who had been hither sent on the debating</p><p class="line">A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and</p><p class="line">Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,</p><p class="line">Ere a determinate resolution, he,</p><p class="line">I mean the bishop, did require a respite,</p><p class="line">Wherein he might the king his lord advertise</p><p class="line">Whether our daughter were legitimate,</p><p class="line">Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,</p><p class="line">Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook</p><p class="line">The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,</p><p class="line">Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble</p><p class="line">The region of my breast, which forced such way,</p><p class="line">That many mazed considerings did throng</p><p class="line">And press'd in with this caution. First, methought</p><p class="line">I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had</p><p class="line">Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,</p><p class="line">If it conceived a male child by me, should</p><p class="line">Do no more offices of life to't than</p><p class="line">The grave does to the dead, for her male issue</p><p class="line">Or died where they were made, or shortly after</p><p class="line">This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,</p><p class="line">This was a judgment on me, that my kingdom,</p><p class="line">Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not</p><p class="line">Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that</p><p class="line">I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in</p><p class="line">By this my issue's fail, and that gave to me</p><p class="line">Many a groaning throe.
