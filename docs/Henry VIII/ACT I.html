Such as give</p><p class="line">Their money out of hope they may believe,</p><p class="line">May here find truth too.

How have ye done</p><p class="line">Since last we saw in France?</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">I thank your grace,</p><p class="line">Healthful, and ever since a fresh admirer</p><p class="line">Of what I saw there.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">An untimely ague</p><p class="line">Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when</p><p class="line">Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,</p><p class="line">Met in the vale of Andren.</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">'Twixt Guynes and Arde:</p><p class="line">I was then present, saw them salute on horseback,</p><p class="line">Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung</p><p class="line">In their embracement, as they grew together,</p><p class="line">Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd</p><p class="line">Such a compounded one?</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">All the whole time</p><p class="line">I was my chamber's prisoner.</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">Then you lost</p><p class="line">The view of earthly glory: men might say,</p><p class="line">Till this time pomp was single, but now married</p><p class="line">To one above itself. Each following day</p><p class="line">Became the next day's master, till the last</p><p class="line">Made former wonders its. To-day the French,</p><p class="line">All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,</p><p class="line">Shone down the English, and, to-morrow, they</p><p class="line">Made Britain India: every man that stood</p><p class="line">Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were</p><p class="line">As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,</p><p class="line">Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear</p><p class="line">The pride upon them, that their very labour</p><p class="line">Was to them as a painting: now this masque</p><p class="line">Was cried incomparable, and the ensuing night</p><p class="line">Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,</p><p class="line">Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,</p><p class="line">As presence did present them, him in eye,</p><p class="line">Still him in praise: and, being present both</p><p class="line">'Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner</p><p class="line">Durst wag his tongue in censure.

What had he</p><p class="line">To do in these fierce vanities?

He makes up the file</p><p class="line">Of all the gentry, for the most part such</p><p class="line">To whom as great a charge as little honour</p><p class="line">He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,</p><p class="line">The honourable board of council out,</p><p class="line">Must fetch him in the papers.</p><p class="player">ABERGAVENNY</p><p class="line">I do know</p><p class="line">Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have</p><p class="line">By this so sickened their estates, that never</p><p class="line">They shall abound as formerly.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">O, many</p><p class="line">Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em</p><p class="line">For this great journey.

You know his nature,</p><p class="line">That he's revengeful, and I know his sword</p><p class="line">Hath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,</p><p class="line">It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,</p><p class="line">Thither he darts it.

This holy fox,</p><p class="line">Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous</p><p class="line">As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief</p><p class="line">As able to perform't, his mind and place</p><p class="line">Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally--</p><p class="line">Only to show his pomp as well in France</p><p class="line">As here at home, suggests the king our master</p><p class="line">To this last costly treaty, the interview,</p><p class="line">That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass</p><p class="line">Did break i' the rinsing.</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">Faith, and so it did.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal</p><p class="line">The articles o' the combination drew</p><p class="line">As himself pleased, and they were ratified</p><p class="line">As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end</p><p class="line">As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal</p><p class="line">Has done this, and 'tis well, for worthy Wolsey,</p><p class="line">Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--</p><p class="line">Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy</p><p class="line">To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,</p><p class="line">Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--</p><p class="line">For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came</p><p class="line">To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:</p><p class="line">His fears were, that the interview betwixt</p><p class="line">England and France might, through their amity,</p><p class="line">Breed him some prejudice, for from this league</p><p class="line">Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily</p><p class="line">Deals with our cardinal, and, as I trow,--</p><p class="line">Which I do well, for I am sure the emperor</p><p class="line">Paid ere he promised, whereby his suit was granted</p><p class="line">Ere it was ask'd, but when the way was made,</p><p class="line">And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,</p><p class="line">That he would please to alter the king's course,</p><p class="line">And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,</p><p class="line">As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal</p><p class="line">Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,</p><p class="line">And for his own advantage.</p><p class="player">NORFOLK</p><p class="line">I am sorry</p><p class="line">To hear this of him, and could wish he were</p><p class="line">Something mistaken in't.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">No, not a syllable:</p><p class="line">I  do pronounce him in that very shape</p><p class="line">He shall appear in proof.</p><p class="action">Enter BRANDON, a Sergeant-at-arms before him, and two or three of the Guard</p><p class="player">BRANDON</p><p class="line">Your office, sergeant, execute it.</p><p class="player">Sergeant</p><p class="line">Sir,</p><p class="line">My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl</p><p class="line">Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I</p><p class="line">Arrest thee of high treason, in the name</p><p class="line">Of our most sovereign king.</p><p class="player">BUCKINGHAM</p><p class="line">Lo, you, my lord,</p><p class="line">The net has fall'n upon me!
