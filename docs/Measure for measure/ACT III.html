A room in the prison.</p><p class="action">Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before, CLAUDIO, and Provost</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?</p><p class="player">CLAUDIO</p><p class="line">The miserable have no other medicine</p><p class="line">But only hope:</p><p class="line">I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">Be absolute for death, either death or life</p><p class="line">Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:</p><p class="line">If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing</p><p class="line">That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,</p><p class="line">Servile to all the skyey influences,</p><p class="line">That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,</p><p class="line">Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool,</p><p class="line">For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun</p><p class="line">And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble,</p><p class="line">For all the accommodations that thou bear'st</p><p class="line">Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant,</p><p class="line">For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork</p><p class="line">Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,</p><p class="line">And that thou oft provokest, yet grossly fear'st</p><p class="line">Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself,</p><p class="line">For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains</p><p class="line">That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not,</p><p class="line">For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,</p><p class="line">And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain,</p><p class="line">For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,</p><p class="line">After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor,</p><p class="line">For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,</p><p class="line">Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,</p><p class="line">And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none,</p><p class="line">For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,</p><p class="line">The mere effusion of thy proper loins,</p><p class="line">Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,</p><p class="line">For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,</p><p class="line">But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,</p><p class="line">Dreaming on both, for all thy blessed youth</p><p class="line">Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms</p><p class="line">Of palsied eld, and when thou art old and rich,</p><p class="line">Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,</p><p class="line">To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this</p><p class="line">That bears the name of life? Yet in this life</p><p class="line">Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,</p><p class="line">That makes these odds all even.</p><p class="player">CLAUDIO</p><p class="line">I humbly thank you.</p><p class="line">To sue to live, I find I seek to die,</p><p class="line">And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">[Within]  What, ho!

Angelo had never the purpose to</p><p class="line">corrupt her, only he hath made an essay of her</p><p class="line">virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition</p><p class="line">of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,</p><p class="line">hath made him that gracious denial which he is most</p><p class="line">glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I</p><p class="line">know this to be true, therefore prepare yourself to</p><p class="line">death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes</p><p class="line">that are fallible: tomorrow you must die, go to</p><p class="line">your knees and make ready.</p><p class="player">CLAUDIO</p><p class="line">Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love</p><p class="line">with life that I will sue to be rid of it.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">Hold you there: farewell.</p><p class="action">Exit CLAUDIO</p><p class="line">Provost, a word with you!</p><p class="action">Re-enter Provost</p><p class="player">Provost</p><p class="line">What's your will, father</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me</p><p class="line">awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my</p><p class="line">habit no loss shall touch her by my company.</p><p class="player">Provost</p><p class="line">In good time.</p><p class="action">Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:</p><p class="line">the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty</p><p class="line">brief in goodness, but grace, being the soul of</p><p class="line">your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever</p><p class="line">fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,</p><p class="line">fortune hath conveyed to my understanding, and, but</p><p class="line">that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should</p><p class="line">wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this</p><p class="line">substitute, and to save your brother?</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my</p><p class="line">brother die by the law than my son should be</p><p class="line">unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke</p><p class="line">deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can</p><p class="line">speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or</p><p class="line">discover his government.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter</p><p class="line">now stands, he will avoid your accusation, he made</p><p class="line">trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my</p><p class="line">advisings: to the love I have in doing good a</p><p class="line">remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe</p><p class="line">that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged</p><p class="line">lady a merited benefit, redeem your brother from</p><p class="line">the angry law, do no stain to your own gracious</p><p class="line">person, and much please the absent duke, if</p><p class="line">peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of</p><p class="line">this business.</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do</p><p class="line">anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have</p><p class="line">you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of</p><p class="line">Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">She should this Angelo have married, was affianced</p><p class="line">to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between</p><p class="line">which time of the contract and limit of the</p><p class="line">solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,</p><p class="line">having in that perished vessel the dowry of his</p><p class="line">sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the</p><p class="line">poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and</p><p class="line">renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most</p><p class="line">kind and natural, with him, the portion and sinew of</p><p class="line">her fortune, her marriage-dowry, with both, her</p><p class="line">combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them</p><p class="line">with his comfort, swallowed his vows whole,</p><p class="line">pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,</p><p class="line">bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet</p><p class="line">wears for his sake, and he, a marble to her tears,</p><p class="line">is washed with them, but relents not.</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid</p><p class="line">from the world! What corruption in this life, that</p><p class="line">it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the</p><p class="line">cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps</p><p class="line">you from dishonour in doing it.</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">Show me how, good father.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance</p><p class="line">of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that</p><p class="line">in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,</p><p class="line">like an impediment in the current, made it more</p><p class="line">violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo, answer his</p><p class="line">requiring with a plausible obedience, agree with</p><p class="line">his demands to the point, only refer yourself to</p><p class="line">this advantage, first, that your stay with him may</p><p class="line">not be long, that the time may have all shadow and</p><p class="line">silence in it, and the place answer to convenience.</p><p class="line">This being granted in course,--and now follows</p><p class="line">all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up</p><p class="line">your appointment, go in your place, if the encounter</p><p class="line">acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to</p><p class="line">her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother</p><p class="line">saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana</p><p class="line">advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid</p><p class="line">will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you</p><p class="line">think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness</p><p class="line">of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.</p><p class="line">What think you of it?</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">The image of it gives me content already, and I</p><p class="line">trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily</p><p class="line">to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his</p><p class="line">bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will</p><p class="line">presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated</p><p class="line">grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that</p><p class="line">place call upon me, and dispatch with Angelo, that</p><p class="line">it may be quickly.</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">I thank you for this comfort.

Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence, he</p><p class="line">puts transgression to 't.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">He does well in 't.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in</p><p class="line">him: something too crabbed that way, friar.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred,</p><p class="line">it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp</p><p class="line">it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put</p><p class="line">down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and</p><p class="line">woman after this downright way of creation: is it</p><p class="line">true, think you?</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">How should he be made, then?</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">Some report a sea-maid spawned him, some, that he</p><p class="line">was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is</p><p class="line">certain that when he makes water his urine is</p><p class="line">congealed ice, that I know to be true: and he is a</p><p class="line">motion generative, that's infallible.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the</p><p class="line">rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a</p><p class="line">man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?</p><p class="line">Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a</p><p class="line">hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing</p><p class="line">a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he</p><p class="line">knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">I never heard the absent duke much detected for</p><p class="line">women, he was not inclined that way.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">O, sir, you are deceived.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">'Tis not possible.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty, and</p><p class="line">his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the</p><p class="line">duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too,</p><p class="line">that let me inform you.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">You do him wrong, surely.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the</p><p class="line">duke: and I believe I know the cause of his</p><p class="line">withdrawing.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">What, I prithee, might be the cause?</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">No, pardon, 'tis a secret must be locked within the</p><p class="line">teeth and the lips: but this I can let you</p><p class="line">understand, the greater file of the subject held the</p><p class="line">duke to be wise.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">Wise! why, no question but he was.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:</p><p class="line">the very stream of his life and the business he hath</p><p class="line">helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better</p><p class="line">proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own</p><p class="line">bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the</p><p class="line">envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.</p><p class="line">Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your</p><p class="line">knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">Sir, I know him, and I love him.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with</p><p class="line">dearer love.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">Come, sir, I know what I know.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">I can hardly believe that, since you know not what</p><p class="line">you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our</p><p class="line">prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your</p><p class="line">answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,</p><p class="line">you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call</p><p class="line">upon you, and, I pray you, your name?</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the duke.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to</p><p class="line">report you.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">I fear you not.</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">O, you hope the duke will return no more, or you</p><p class="line">imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I</p><p class="line">can do you little harm, you'll forswear this again.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,</p><p class="line">friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if</p><p class="line">Claudio die to-morrow or no?</p><p class="player">DUKE VINCENTIO</p><p class="line">Why should he die, sir?</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would</p><p class="line">the duke we talk of were returned again: the</p><p class="line">ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with</p><p class="line">continency, sparrows must not build in his</p><p class="line">house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke</p><p class="line">yet would have dark deeds darkly answered, he would</p><p class="line">never bring them to light: would he were returned!</p><p class="line">Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.</p><p class="line">Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The</p><p class="line">duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on</p><p class="line">Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,</p><p class="line">he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown</p><p class="line">bread and garlic: say that I said so.
