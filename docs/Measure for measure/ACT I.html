Can you so stead me</p><p class="line">As bring me to the sight of Isabella,</p><p class="line">A novice of this place and the fair sister</p><p class="line">To her unhappy brother Claudio?</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,</p><p class="line">The rather for I now must make you know</p><p class="line">I am that Isabella and his sister.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:</p><p class="line">Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">Woe me! for what?</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">For that which, if myself might be his judge,</p><p class="line">He should receive his punishment in thanks:</p><p class="line">He hath got his friend with child.</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">Sir, make me not your story.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">It is true.</p><p class="line">I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin</p><p class="line">With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,</p><p class="line">Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:</p><p class="line">I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.</p><p class="line">By your renouncement an immortal spirit,</p><p class="line">And to be talk'd with in sincerity,</p><p class="line">As with a saint.</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:</p><p class="line">Your brother and his lover have embraced:</p><p class="line">As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time</p><p class="line">That from the seedness the bare fallow brings</p><p class="line">To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb</p><p class="line">Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">Is she your cousin?</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">Adoptedly, as school-maids change their names</p><p class="line">By vain though apt affection.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">She it is.</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">O, let him marry her.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">This is the point.</p><p class="line">The duke is very strangely gone from hence,</p><p class="line">Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,</p><p class="line">In hand and hope of action: but we do learn</p><p class="line">By those that know the very nerves of state,</p><p class="line">His givings-out were of an infinite distance</p><p class="line">From his true-meant design. Upon his place,</p><p class="line">And with full line of his authority,</p><p class="line">Governs Lord Angelo, a man whose blood</p><p class="line">Is very snow-broth, one who never feels</p><p class="line">The wanton stings and motions of the sense,</p><p class="line">But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge</p><p class="line">With profits of the mind, study and fast.</p><p class="line">He--to give fear to use and liberty,</p><p class="line">Which have for long run by the hideous law,</p><p class="line">As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,</p><p class="line">Under whose heavy sense your brother's life</p><p class="line">Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it,</p><p class="line">And follows close the rigour of the statute,</p><p class="line">To make him an example. All hope is gone,</p><p class="line">Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer</p><p class="line">To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business</p><p class="line">'Twixt you and your poor brother.</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">Doth he so seek his life?</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">Has censured him</p><p class="line">Already, and, as I hear, the provost hath</p><p class="line">A warrant for his execution.</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">Alas! what poor ability's in me</p><p class="line">To do him good?</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">Assay the power you have.</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">My power? Alas, I doubt--</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">Our doubts are traitors</p><p class="line">And make us lose the good we oft might win</p><p class="line">By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,</p><p class="line">And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,</p><p class="line">Men give like gods, but when they weep and kneel,</p><p class="line">All their petitions are as freely theirs</p><p class="line">As they themselves would owe them.</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">I'll see what I can do.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">But speedily.</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">I will about it straight,</p><p class="line">No longer staying but to give the mother</p><p class="line">Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:</p><p class="line">Commend me to my brother: soon at night</p><p class="line">I'll send him certain word of my success.</p><p class="player">LUCIO</p><p class="line">I take my leave of you.</p><p class="player">ISABELLA</p><p class="line">Good sir, adieu.</p><p class="action">Exeunt</p></body></html>
