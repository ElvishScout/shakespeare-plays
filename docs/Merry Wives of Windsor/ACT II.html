What tempest, I trow,</p><p class="line">threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his</p><p class="line">belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged</p><p class="line">on him? I think the best way were to entertain him</p><p class="line">with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted</p><p class="line">him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?</p><p class="player">MISTRESS PAGE</p><p class="line">Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and</p><p class="line">Ford differs!

I warrant he hath a</p><p class="line">thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for</p><p class="line">different names--sure, more,--and these are of the</p><p class="line">second edition: he will print them, out of doubt,</p><p class="line">for he cares not what he puts into the press, when</p><p class="line">he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,</p><p class="line">and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you</p><p class="line">twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.</p><p class="player">MISTRESS FORD</p><p class="line">Why, this is the very same, the very hand, the very</p><p class="line">words.
