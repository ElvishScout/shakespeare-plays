Meeting two such wealsmen as</p><p class="line">you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink</p><p class="line">you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a</p><p class="line">crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have</p><p class="line">delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in</p><p class="line">compound with the major part of your syllables: and</p><p class="line">though I must be content to bear with those that say</p><p class="line">you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that</p><p class="line">tell you you have good faces.

When you are hearing a</p><p class="line">matter between party and party, if you chance to be</p><p class="line">pinched with the colic, you make faces like</p><p class="line">mummers, set up the bloody flag against all</p><p class="line">patience, and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,</p><p class="line">dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled</p><p class="line">by your hearing: all the peace you make in their</p><p class="line">cause is, calling both the parties knaves.
