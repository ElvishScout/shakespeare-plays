And then the lover,</p><p class="line">Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad</p><p class="line">Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,</p><p class="line">Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,</p><p class="line">Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,</p><p class="line">Seeking the bubble reputation</p><p class="line">Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,</p><p class="line">In fair round belly with good capon lined,</p><p class="line">With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,</p><p class="line">Full of wise saws and modern instances,</p><p class="line">And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts</p><p class="line">Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,</p><p class="line">With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,</p><p class="line">His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide</p><p class="line">For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,</p><p class="line">Turning again toward childish treble, pipes</p><p class="line">And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,</p><p class="line">That ends this strange eventful history,</p><p class="line">Is second childishness and mere oblivion,</p><p class="line">Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</p><p class="action">Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM</p><p class="player">DUKE SENIOR</p><p class="line">Welcome.
