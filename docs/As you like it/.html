Besides this nothing that he so</p><p class="line">plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave</p><p class="line">me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets</p><p class="line">me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a</p><p class="line">brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my</p><p class="line">gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that</p><p class="line">grieves me, and the spirit of my father, which I</p><p class="line">think is within me, begins to mutiny against this</p><p class="line">servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I</p><p class="line">know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</p><p class="player">ADAM</p><p class="line">Yonder comes my master, your brother.</p><p class="player">ORLANDO</p><p class="line">Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will</p><p class="line">shake me up.</p><p class="line">Enter OLIVER</p><p class="player">OLIVER</p><p class="line">Now, sir! what make you here?</p><p class="player">ORLANDO</p><p class="line">Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.</p><p class="player">OLIVER</p><p class="line">What mar you then, sir?</p><p class="player">ORLANDO</p><p class="line">Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God</p><p class="line">made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.</p><p class="player">OLIVER</p><p class="line">Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.</p><p class="player">ORLANDO</p><p class="line">Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?</p><p class="line">What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should</p><p class="line">come to such penury?</p><p class="player">OLIVER</p><p class="line">Know you where your are, sir?</p><p class="player">ORLANDO</p><p class="line">O, sir, very well, here in your orchard.</p><p class="player">OLIVER</p><p class="line">Know you before whom, sir?</p><p class="player">ORLANDO</p><p class="line">Ay, better than him I am before knows me.

I'll tell thee, Charles:</p><p class="line">it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full</p><p class="line">of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's</p><p class="line">good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against</p><p class="line">me his natural brother: therefore use thy</p><p class="line">discretion, I had as lief thou didst break his neck</p><p class="line">as his finger. And thou wert best look to't, for if</p><p class="line">thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not</p><p class="line">mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise</p><p class="line">against thee by poison, entrap thee by some</p><p class="line">treacherous device and never leave thee till he</p><p class="line">hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other,</p><p class="line">for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak</p><p class="line">it, there is not one so young and so villanous this</p><p class="line">day living.
