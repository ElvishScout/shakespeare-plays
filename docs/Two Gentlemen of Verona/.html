know it well, my Lord, and, sure, the match</p><p class="line">Were rich and honourable, besides, the gentleman</p><p class="line">Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities</p><p class="line">Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:</p><p class="line">Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">No, trust me, she is peevish, sullen, froward,</p><p class="line">Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,</p><p class="line">Neither regarding that she is my child</p><p class="line">Nor fearing me as if I were her father,</p><p class="line">And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,</p><p class="line">Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her,</p><p class="line">And, where I thought the remnant of mine age</p><p class="line">Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,</p><p class="line">I now am full resolved to take a wife</p><p class="line">And turn her out to who will take her in:</p><p class="line">Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower,</p><p class="line">For me and my possessions she esteems not.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">What would your Grace have me to do in this?</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">There is a lady in Verona here</p><p class="line">Whom I affect, but she is nice and coy</p><p class="line">And nought esteems my aged eloquence:</p><p class="line">Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--</p><p class="line">For long agone I have forgot to court,</p><p class="line">Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--</p><p class="line">How and which way I may bestow myself</p><p class="line">To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:</p><p class="line">Dumb jewels often in their silent kind</p><p class="line">More than quick words do move a woman's mind.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">But she did scorn a present that I sent her.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.</p><p class="line">Send her another, never give her o'er,</p><p class="line">For scorn at first makes after-love the more.</p><p class="line">If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,</p><p class="line">But rather to beget more love in you:</p><p class="line">If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone,</p><p class="line">For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.</p><p class="line">Take no repulse, whatever she doth say,</p><p class="line">For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'</p><p class="line">Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces,</p><p class="line">Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.</p><p class="line">That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,</p><p class="line">If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">But she I mean is promised by her friends</p><p class="line">Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,</p><p class="line">And kept severely from resort of men,</p><p class="line">That no man hath access by day to her.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">Why, then, I would resort to her by night.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,</p><p class="line">That no man hath recourse to her by night.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">What lets but one may enter at her window?</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,</p><p class="line">And built so shelving that one cannot climb it</p><p class="line">Without apparent hazard of his life.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,</p><p class="line">To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,</p><p class="line">Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,</p><p class="line">So bold Leander would adventure it.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,</p><p class="line">Advise me where I may have such a ladder.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">This very night, for Love is like a child,</p><p class="line">That longs for every thing that he can come by.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">But, hark thee, I will go to her alone:</p><p class="line">How shall I best convey the ladder thither?</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it</p><p class="line">Under a cloak that is of any length.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">Ay, my good lord.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Then let me see thy cloak:</p><p class="line">I'll get me one of such another length.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.</p><p
