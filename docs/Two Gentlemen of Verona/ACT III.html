Milan. The DUKE's palace.</p><p class="action">Enter DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUS</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile,</p><p class="line">We have some secrets to confer about.</p><p class="action">Exit THURIO</p><p class="line">Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?</p><p class="player">PROTEUS</p><p class="line">My gracious lord, that which I would discover</p><p class="line">The law of friendship bids me to conceal,</p><p class="line">But when I call to mind your gracious favours</p><p class="line">Done to me, undeserving as I am,</p><p class="line">My duty pricks me on to utter that</p><p class="line">Which else no worldly good should draw from me.</p><p class="line">Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,</p><p class="line">This night intends to steal away your daughter:</p><p class="line">Myself am one made privy to the plot.</p><p class="line">I know you have determined to bestow her</p><p class="line">On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates,</p><p class="line">And should she thus be stol'n away from you,</p><p class="line">It would be much vexation to your age.</p><p class="line">Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose</p><p class="line">To cross my friend in his intended drift</p><p class="line">Than, by concealing it, heap on your head</p><p class="line">A pack of sorrows which would press you down,</p><p class="line">Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,</p><p class="line">Which to requite, command me while I live.</p><p class="line">This love of theirs myself have often seen,</p><p class="line">Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,</p><p class="line">And oftentimes have purposed to forbid</p><p class="line">Sir Valentine her company and my court:</p><p class="line">But fearing lest my jealous aim might err</p><p class="line">And so unworthily disgrace the man,</p><p class="line">A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,</p><p class="line">I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find</p><p class="line">That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.</p><p class="line">And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,</p><p class="line">Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,</p><p class="line">I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,</p><p class="line">The key whereof myself have ever kept,</p><p class="line">And thence she cannot be convey'd away.</p><p class="player">PROTEUS</p><p class="line">Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean</p><p class="line">How he her chamber-window will ascend</p><p class="line">And with a corded ladder fetch her down,</p><p class="line">For which the youthful lover now is gone</p><p class="line">And this way comes he with it presently,</p><p class="line">Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.</p><p class="line">But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly</p><p class="line">That my discovery be not aimed at,</p><p class="line">For love of you, not hate unto my friend,</p><p class="line">Hath made me publisher of this pretence.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Upon mine honour, he shall never know</p><p class="line">That I had any light from thee of this.</p><p class="player">PROTEUS</p><p class="line">Adieu, my Lord, Sir Valentine is coming.</p><p class="action">Exit</p><p class="action">Enter VALENTINE</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">Please it your grace, there is a messenger</p><p class="line">That stays to bear my letters to my friends,</p><p class="line">And I am going to deliver them.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Be they of much import?</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">The tenor of them doth but signify</p><p class="line">My health and happy being at your court.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Nay then, no matter, stay with me awhile,</p><p class="line">I am to break with thee of some affairs</p><p class="line">That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.</p><p class="line">'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought</p><p class="line">To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">I know it well, my Lord, and, sure, the match</p><p class="line">Were rich and honourable, besides, the gentleman</p><p class="line">Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities</p><p class="line">Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:</p><p class="line">Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">No, trust me, she is peevish, sullen, froward,</p><p class="line">Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,</p><p class="line">Neither regarding that she is my child</p><p class="line">Nor fearing me as if I were her father,</p><p class="line">And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,</p><p class="line">Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her,</p><p class="line">And, where I thought the remnant of mine age</p><p class="line">Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,</p><p class="line">I now am full resolved to take a wife</p><p class="line">And turn her out to who will take her in:</p><p class="line">Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower,</p><p class="line">For me and my possessions she esteems not.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">What would your Grace have me to do in this?</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">There is a lady in Verona here</p><p class="line">Whom I affect, but she is nice and coy</p><p class="line">And nought esteems my aged eloquence:</p><p class="line">Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--</p><p class="line">For long agone I have forgot to court,</p><p class="line">Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--</p><p class="line">How and which way I may bestow myself</p><p class="line">To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:</p><p class="line">Dumb jewels often in their silent kind</p><p class="line">More than quick words do move a woman's mind.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">But she did scorn a present that I sent her.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.</p><p class="line">Send her another, never give her o'er,</p><p class="line">For scorn at first makes after-love the more.</p><p class="line">If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,</p><p class="line">But rather to beget more love in you:</p><p class="line">If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone,</p><p class="line">For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.</p><p class="line">Take no repulse, whatever she doth say,</p><p class="line">For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'</p><p class="line">Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces,</p><p class="line">Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.</p><p class="line">That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,</p><p class="line">If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">But she I mean is promised by her friends</p><p class="line">Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,</p><p class="line">And kept severely from resort of men,</p><p class="line">That no man hath access by day to her.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">Why, then, I would resort to her by night.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,</p><p class="line">That no man hath recourse to her by night.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">What lets but one may enter at her window?</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,</p><p class="line">And built so shelving that one cannot climb it</p><p class="line">Without apparent hazard of his life.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,</p><p class="line">To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,</p><p class="line">Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,</p><p class="line">So bold Leander would adventure it.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,</p><p class="line">Advise me where I may have such a ladder.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">This very night, for Love is like a child,</p><p class="line">That longs for every thing that he can come by.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">But, hark thee, I will go to her alone:</p><p class="line">How shall I best convey the ladder thither?</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it</p><p class="line">Under a cloak that is of any length.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">Ay, my good lord.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Then let me see thy cloak:</p><p class="line">I'll get me one of such another length.</p><p class="player">VALENTINE</p><p class="line">Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?</p><p class="line">I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.</p><p class="line">What letter is this same?

The DUKE's palace.</p><p class="action">Enter DUKE and THURIO</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,</p><p class="line">Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.</p><p class="player">THURIO</p><p class="line">Since his exile she hath despised me most,</p><p class="line">Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,</p><p class="line">That I am desperate of obtaining her.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">This weak impress of love is as a figure</p><p class="line">Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat</p><p class="line">Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.</p><p class="line">A little time will melt her frozen thoughts</p><p class="line">And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.</p><p class="action">Enter PROTEUS</p><p class="line">How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman</p><p class="line">According to our proclamation gone?</p><p class="player">PROTEUS</p><p class="line">Gone, my good lord.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">My daughter takes his going grievously.</p><p class="player">PROTEUS</p><p class="line">A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">So I believe, but Thurio thinks not so.</p><p class="line">Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--</p><p class="line">For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--</p><p class="line">Makes me the better to confer with thee.</p><p class="player">PROTEUS</p><p class="line">Longer than I prove loyal to your grace</p><p class="line">Let me not live to look upon your grace.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Thou know'st how willingly I would effect</p><p class="line">The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.</p><p class="player">PROTEUS</p><p class="line">I do, my lord.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">And also, I think, thou art not ignorant</p><p class="line">How she opposes her against my will</p><p class="player">PROTEUS</p><p class="line">She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Ay, and perversely she persevers so.</p><p class="line">What might we do to make the girl forget</p><p class="line">The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?</p><p class="player">PROTEUS</p><p class="line">The best way is to slander Valentine</p><p class="line">With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,</p><p class="line">Three things that women highly hold in hate.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.</p><p class="player">PROTEUS</p><p class="line">Ay, if his enemy deliver it:</p><p class="line">Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken</p><p class="line">By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Then you must undertake to slander him.</p><p class="player">PROTEUS</p><p class="line">And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:</p><p class="line">'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,</p><p class="line">Especially against his very friend.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Where your good word cannot advantage him,</p><p class="line">Your slander never can endamage him,</p><p class="line">Therefore the office is indifferent,</p><p class="line">Being entreated to it by your friend.</p><p class="player">PROTEUS</p><p class="line">You have prevail'd, my lord, if I can do it</p><p class="line">By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,</p><p class="line">She shall not long continue love to him.</p><p class="line">But say this weed her love from Valentine,</p><p class="line">It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.</p><p class="player">THURIO</p><p class="line">Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,</p><p class="line">Lest it should ravel and be good to none,</p><p class="line">You must provide to bottom it on me,</p><p class="line">Which must be done by praising me as much</p><p class="line">As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,</p><p class="line">Because we know, on Valentine's report,</p><p class="line">You are already Love's firm votary</p><p class="line">And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.</p><p class="line">Upon this warrant shall you have access</p><p class="line">Where you with Silvia may confer at large,</p><p class="line">For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,</p><p class="line">And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you,</p><p class="line">Where you may temper her by your persuasion</p><p class="line">To hate young Valentine and love my friend.</p><p class="player">PROTEUS</p><p class="line">As much as I can do, I will effect:</p><p class="line">But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough,</p><p class="line">You must lay lime to tangle her desires</p><p class="line">By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes</p><p class="line">Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Ay,</p><p class="line">Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.</p><p class="player">PROTEUS</p><p class="line">Say that upon the altar of her beauty</p><p class="line">You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:</p><p class="line">Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears</p><p class="line">Moist it again, and frame some feeling line</p><p class="line">That may discover such integrity:</p><p class="line">For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,</p><p class="line">Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,</p><p class="line">Make tigers tame and huge leviathans</p><p class="line">Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.</p><p class="line">After your dire-lamenting elegies,</p><p class="line">Visit by night your lady's chamber-window</p><p class="line">With some sweet concert, to their instruments</p><p class="line">Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence</p><p class="line">Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.</p><p class="line">This, or else nothing, will inherit her.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">This discipline shows thou hast been in love.</p><p class="player">THURIO</p><p class="line">And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.</p><p class="line">Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,</p><p class="line">Let us into the city presently</p><p class="line">To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.</p><p class="line">I have a sonnet that will serve the turn</p><p class="line">To give the onset to thy good advice.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">About it, gentlemen!</p><p class="player">PROTEUS</p><p class="line">We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,</p><p class="line">And afterward determine our proceedings.</p><p class="player">DUKE</p><p class="line">Even now about it! I will pardon you.</p><p class="action">Exeunt</p></div></body></html>
