For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue</p><p class="line">and a quiet sword, by the means whereof a' breaks</p><p class="line">words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath</p><p class="line">heard that men of few words are the best men, and</p><p class="line">therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'</p><p class="line">should be thought a coward: but his few bad words</p><p class="line">are matched with as few good deeds, for a' never</p><p class="line">broke any man's head but his own, and that was</p><p class="line">against a post when he was drunk. They will steal</p><p class="line">any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a</p><p class="line">lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for</p><p class="line">three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn</p><p class="line">brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a</p><p class="line">fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the</p><p class="line">men would carry coals. They would have me as</p><p class="line">familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their</p><p class="line">handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,</p><p class="line">if I should take from another's pocket to put into</p><p class="line">mine, for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs.

Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we</p><p class="line">do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish</p><p class="line">as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess</p><p class="line">him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing</p><p class="line">it, should dishearten his army.</p><p class="player">BATES</p><p class="line">He may show what outward courage he will, but I</p><p class="line">believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish</p><p class="line">himself in Thames up to the neck, and so I would he</p><p class="line">were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:</p><p class="line">I think he would not wish himself any where but</p><p class="line">where he is.</p><p class="player">BATES</p><p class="line">Then I would he were here alone, so should he be</p><p class="line">sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here</p><p class="line">alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's</p><p class="line">minds: methinks I could not die any where so</p><p class="line">contented as in the king's company, his cause being</p><p class="line">just and his quarrel honourable.</p><p class="player">WILLIAMS</p><p class="line">That's more than we know.</p><p class="player">BATES</p><p class="line">Ay, or more than we should seek after, for we know</p><p class="line">enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if</p><p class="line">his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes</p><p class="line">the crime of it out of us.</p><p class="player">WILLIAMS</p><p class="line">But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath</p><p class="line">a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and</p><p class="line">arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join</p><p class="line">together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at</p><p class="line">such a place,' some swearing, some crying for a</p><p class="line">surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind</p><p class="line">them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their</p><p class="line">children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die</p><p class="line">well that die in a battle, for how can they</p><p class="line">charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their</p><p class="line">argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it</p><p class="line">will be a black matter for the king that led them to</p><p class="line">it, whom to disobey were against all proportion of</p><p class="line">subjection.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">So, if a son that is by his father sent about</p><p class="line">merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the</p><p class="line">imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be</p><p class="line">imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a</p><p class="line">servant, under his master's command transporting a</p><p class="line">sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in</p><p class="line">many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the</p><p class="line">business of the master the author of the servant's</p><p class="line">damnation: but this is not so: the king is not</p><p class="line">bound to answer the particular endings of his</p><p class="line">soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of</p><p class="line">his servant, for they purpose not their death, when</p><p class="line">they purpose their services. Besides, there is no</p><p class="line">king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to</p><p class="line">the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all</p><p class="line">unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them</p><p class="line">the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder,</p><p class="line">some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of</p><p class="line">perjury, some, making the wars their bulwark, that</p><p class="line">have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with</p><p class="line">pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have</p><p class="line">defeated the law and outrun native punishment,</p><p class="line">though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to</p><p class="line">fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance,</p><p class="line">so that here men are punished for before-breach of</p><p class="line">the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where</p><p class="line">they feared the death, they have borne life away,</p><p class="line">and where they would be safe, they perish: then if</p><p class="line">they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of</p><p class="line">their damnation than he was before guilty of those</p><p class="line">impieties for the which they are now visited. Every</p><p class="line">subject's duty is the king's, but every subject's</p><p class="line">soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in</p><p class="line">the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every</p><p class="line">mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death</p><p class="line">is to him advantage, or not dying, the time was</p><p class="line">blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:</p><p class="line">and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think</p><p class="line">that, making God so free an offer, He let him</p><p class="line">outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach</p><p class="line">others how they should prepare.</p><p class="player">WILLIAMS</p><p class="line">'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon</p><p class="line">his own head, the king is not to answer it.</p><p class="player">BATES</p><p class="line">But I do not desire he should answer for me, and</p><p class="line">yet I determine to fight lustily for him.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.</p><p class="player">WILLIAMS</p><p class="line">Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but</p><p class="line">when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we</p><p class="line">ne'er the wiser.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.</p><p class="player">WILLIAMS</p><p class="line">You pay him then.

I know no ways to mince it in love, but</p><p class="line">directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me</p><p class="line">farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out</p><p class="line">my suit. Give me your answer, i' faith, do: and so</p><p class="line">clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?</p><p class="player">KATHARINE</p><p class="line">Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for</p><p class="line">your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I</p><p class="line">have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I</p><p class="line">have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable</p><p class="line">measure in strength. If I could win a lady at</p><p class="line">leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my</p><p class="line">armour on my back, under the correction of bragging</p><p class="line">be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.</p><p class="line">Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse</p><p class="line">for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and</p><p class="line">sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,</p><p class="line">Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my</p><p class="line">eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation,</p><p class="line">only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,</p><p class="line">nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a</p><p class="line">fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth</p><p class="line">sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love</p><p class="line">of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy</p><p class="line">cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst</p><p class="line">love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee</p><p class="line">that I shall die, is true, but for thy love, by the</p><p class="line">Lord, no, yet I love thee too. And while thou</p><p class="line">livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and</p><p class="line">uncoined constancy, for he perforce must do thee</p><p class="line">right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other</p><p class="line">places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that</p><p class="line">can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do</p><p class="line">always reason themselves out again. What! a</p><p class="line">speaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad. A</p><p class="line">good leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a</p><p class="line">black beard will turn white, a curled pate will grow</p><p class="line">bald, a fair face will wither, a full eye will wax</p><p class="line">hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the</p><p class="line">moon, or, rather, the sun, and not the moon, for it</p><p class="line">shines bright and never changes, but keeps his</p><p class="line">course truly. If thou would have such a one, take</p><p class="line">me, and take me, take a soldier, take a soldier,</p><p class="line">take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?</p><p class="line">speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.</p><p class="player">KATHARINE</p><p class="line">Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of</p><p class="line">France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love</p><p class="line">the friend of France, for I love France so well that</p><p class="line">I will not part with a village of it, I will have it</p><p class="line">all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am</p><p class="line">yours, then yours is France and you are mine.</p><p class="player">KATHARINE</p><p class="line">I cannot tell vat is dat.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">No, Kate?

Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre est</p><p class="line">France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,</p><p class="line">Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much</p><p class="line">more French: I shall never move thee in French,</p><p class="line">unless it be to laugh at me.</p><p class="player">KATHARINE</p><p class="line">Sauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez, il</p><p class="line">est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">No, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of my</p><p class="line">tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs</p><p class="line">be granted to be much at one.

If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a</p><p class="line">saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get</p><p class="line">thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs</p><p class="line">prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,</p><p class="line">between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a</p><p class="line">boy, half French, half English, that shall go to</p><p class="line">Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?</p><p class="line">shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair</p><p class="line">flower-de-luce?</p><p class="player">KATHARINE</p><p class="line">I do not know dat</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">No, 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: do</p><p class="line">but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your</p><p class="line">French part of such a boy, and for my English moiety</p><p class="line">take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer</p><p class="line">you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cher</p><p class="line">et devin deesse?</p><p class="player">KATHARINE</p><p class="line">Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de</p><p class="line">most sage demoiselle dat is en France.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">Now, fie upon my false French!
