I know no ways to mince it in love, but</p><p class="line">directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me</p><p class="line">farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out</p><p class="line">my suit. Give me your answer, i' faith, do: and so</p><p class="line">clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?</p><p class="player">KATHARINE</p><p class="line">Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for</p><p class="line">your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I</p><p class="line">have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I</p><p class="line">have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable</p><p class="line">measure in strength. If I could win a lady at</p><p class="line">leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my</p><p class="line">armour on my back, under the correction of bragging</p><p class="line">be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.</p><p class="line">Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse</p><p class="line">for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and</p><p class="line">sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,</p><p class="line">Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my</p><p class="line">eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation,</p><p class="line">only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,</p><p class="line">nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a</p><p class="line">fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth</p><p class="line">sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love</p><p class="line">of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy</p><p class="line">cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst</p><p class="line">love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee</p><p class="line">that I shall die, is true, but for thy love, by the</p><p class="line">Lord, no, yet I love thee too. And while thou</p><p class="line">livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and</p><p class="line">uncoined constancy, for he perforce must do thee</p><p class="line">right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other</p><p class="line">places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that</p><p class="line">can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do</p><p class="line">always reason themselves out again. What! a</p><p class="line">speaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad. A</p><p class="line">good leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a</p><p class="line">black beard will turn white, a curled pate will grow</p><p class="line">bald, a fair face will wither, a full eye will wax</p><p class="line">hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the</p><p class="line">moon, or, rather, the sun, and not the moon, for it</p><p class="line">shines bright and never changes, but keeps his</p><p class="line">course truly. If thou would have such a one, take</p><p class="line">me, and take me, take a soldier, take a soldier,</p><p class="line">take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?</p><p class="line">speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.</p><p class="player">KATHARINE</p><p class="line">Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of</p><p class="line">France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love</p><p class="line">the friend of France, for I love France so well that</p><p class="line">I will not part with a village of it, I will have it</p><p class="line">all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am</p><p class="line">yours, then yours is France and you are mine.</p><p class="player">KATHARINE</p><p class="line">I cannot tell vat is dat.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">No, Kate?

If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a</p><p class="line">saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get</p><p class="line">thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs</p><p class="line">prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,</p><p class="line">between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a</p><p class="line">boy, half French, half English, that shall go to</p><p class="line">Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?</p><p class="line">shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair</p><p class="line">flower-de-luce?</p><p class="player">KATHARINE</p><p class="line">I do not know dat</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">No, 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: do</p><p class="line">but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your</p><p class="line">French part of such a boy, and for my English moiety</p><p class="line">take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer</p><p class="line">you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cher</p><p class="line">et devin deesse?</p><p class="player">KATHARINE</p><p class="line">Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de</p><p class="line">most sage demoiselle dat is en France.</p><p class="player">KING HENRY V</p><p class="line">Now, fie upon my false French!
