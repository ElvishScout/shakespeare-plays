A room in PORTIA'S house.</p><p class="line">Enter PORTIA and NERISSA</p><p class="player">PORTIA</p><p class="line">By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of</p><p class="line">this great world.</p><p class="player">NERISSA</p><p class="line">You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in</p><p class="line">the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and</p><p class="line">yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit</p><p class="line">with too much as they that starve with nothing. It</p><p class="line">is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the</p><p class="line">mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but</p><p class="line">competency lives longer.</p><p class="player">PORTIA</p><p class="line">Good sentences and well pronounced.</p><p class="player">NERISSA</p><p class="line">They would be better, if well followed.</p><p class="player">PORTIA</p><p class="line">If to do were as easy as to know what were good to</p><p class="line">do, chapels had been churches and poor men's</p><p class="line">cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that</p><p class="line">follows his own instructions: I can easier teach</p><p class="line">twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the</p><p class="line">twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may</p><p class="line">devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps</p><p class="line">o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the</p><p class="line">youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the</p><p class="line">cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to</p><p class="line">choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may</p><p class="line">neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I</p><p class="line">dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curbed</p><p class="line">by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,</p><p class="line">Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?</p><p class="player">NERISSA</p><p class="line">Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their</p><p class="line">death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,</p><p class="line">that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,</p><p class="line">silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning</p><p class="line">chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any</p><p class="line">rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what</p><p class="line">warmth is there in your affection towards any of</p><p class="line">these princely suitors that are already come?</p><p class="player">PORTIA</p><p class="line">I pray thee, over-name them, and as thou namest</p><p class="line">them, I will describe them, and, according to my</p><p class="line">description, level at my affection.</p><p class="player">NERISSA</p><p class="line">First, there is the Neapolitan prince.</p><p class="player">PORTIA</p><p class="line">Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but</p><p class="line">talk of his horse, and he makes it a great</p><p class="line">appropriation to his own good parts, that he can</p><p class="line">shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his</p><p class="line">mother played false with a smith.</p><p class="player">NERISSA</p><p class="line">Then there is the County Palatine.</p><p class="player">PORTIA</p><p class="line">He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you</p><p class="line">will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and</p><p class="line">smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping</p><p class="line">philosopher when he grows old, being so full of</p><p class="line">unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be</p><p class="line">married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth</p><p class="line">than to either of these. God defend me from these</p><p class="line">two!</p><p class="player">NERISSA</p><p class="line">How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?</p><p class="player">PORTIA</p><p class="line">God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.</p><p class="line">In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,</p><p class="line">he! why, he hath a horse better than the</p><p class="line">Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than</p><p class="line">the Count Palatine, he is every man in no man, if a</p><p class="line">throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will</p><p class="line">fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I</p><p class="line">should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me</p><p class="line">I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I</p><p class="line">shall never requite him.</p><p class="player">NERISSA</p><p class="line">What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron</p><p class="line">of England?</p><p class="player">PORTIA</p><p class="line">You know I say nothing to him, for he understands</p><p class="line">not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,</p><p class="line">nor Italian, and you will come into the court and</p><p class="line">swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.</p><p class="line">He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can</p><p class="line">converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!</p><p class="line">I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round</p><p class="line">hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his</p><p class="line">behavior every where.</p><p class="player">NERISSA</p><p class="line">What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?</p><p class="player">PORTIA</p><p class="line">That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he</p><p class="line">borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and</p><p class="line">swore he would pay him again when he was able: I</p><p class="line">think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed</p><p class="line">under for another.</p><p class="player">NERISSA</p><p class="line">How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?</p><p class="player">PORTIA</p><p class="line">Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and</p><p class="line">most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when</p><p class="line">he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and</p><p class="line">when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:</p><p class="line">and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall</p><p class="line">make shift to go without him.</p><p class="player">NERISSA</p><p class="line">If he should offer to choose, and choose the right</p><p class="line">casket, you should refuse to perform your father's</p><p class="line">will, if you should refuse to accept him.</p><p class="player">PORTIA</p><p class="line">Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a</p><p class="line">deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,</p><p class="line">for if the devil be within and that temptation</p><p class="line">without, I know he will choose it. I will do any</p><p class="line">thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.</p><p class="player">NERISSA</p><p class="line">You need not fear, lady, the having any of these</p><p class="line">lords: they have acquainted me with their</p><p class="line">determinations, which is, indeed, to return to their</p><p class="line">home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless</p><p class="line">you may be won by some other sort than your father's</p><p class="line">imposition depending on the caskets.</p><p class="player">PORTIA</p><p class="line">If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as</p><p class="line">chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner</p><p class="line">of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers</p><p class="line">are so reasonable, for there is not one among them</p><p class="line">but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant</p><p class="line">them a fair departure.</p><p class="player">NERISSA</p><p class="line">Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a</p><p class="line">Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither</p><p class="line">in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?</p><p class="player">PORTIA</p><p class="line">Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, he was so called.</p><p class="player">NERISSA</p><p class="line">True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish</p><p class="line">eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.</p><p class="player">PORTIA</p><p class="line">I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of</p><p class="line">thy praise.</p><p class="line">Enter a Serving-man</p><p class="line">How now! what news?</p><p class="player">Servant</p><p class="line">The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take</p><p class="line">their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a</p><p class="line">fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the</p><p class="line">prince his master will be here to-night.</p><p class="player">PORTIA</p><p class="line">If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a</p><p class="line">heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should</p><p class="line">be glad of his approach: if he have the condition</p><p class="line">of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had</p><p class="line">rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,</p><p class="line">Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.</p><p class="line">Whiles we shut the gates</p><p class="line">upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.</p><p class="line">Exeunt</p><p class="line">SCENE III. Venice.
