again by viewing mine:</p><p class="line">I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him,</p><p class="line">I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:</p><p class="line">Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him,</p><p class="line">Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him,</p><p class="player">DUCHESS OF YORK</p><p class="line">I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him,</p><p class="line">I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.</p><p class="player">QUEEN MARGARET</p><p class="line">Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.</p><p class="line">From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept</p><p class="line">A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:</p><p class="line">That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,</p><p class="line">To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,</p><p class="line">That foul defacer of God's handiwork,</p><p class="line">That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,</p><p class="line">That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,</p><p class="line">Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.</p><p class="line">O upright, just, and true-disposing God,</p><p class="line">How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur</p><p class="line">Preys on the issue of his mother's body,</p><p class="line">And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!</p><p class="player">DUCHESS OF YORK</p><p class="line">O Harry's wife, triumph not

because both they</p><p class="line">Match not the high perfection of my loss:</p><p class="line">Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward,</p><p class="line">And the beholders of this tragic

class="line">Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.</p><p class="line">To have him suddenly convey'd away.</p><p class="line">Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,</p><p class="line">That I may live to say, The dog is dead!</p><p class="player">QUEEN ELIZABETH</p><p class="line">O, thou didst prophesy the time would come</p><p class="line">That I should wish for thee

heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below,</p><p class="line">A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes,</p><p class="line">A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,</p><p class="line">A sign of dignity, a garish flag,</p><p class="line">To be the aim of every dangerous shot,</p><p class="line">A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.</p><p class="line">Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?</p><p class="line">Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?</p><p class="line">Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?</p><p class="line">Where be the bending peers that

class="line">To torture thee the more, being what thou art.</p><p class="line">Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not</p><p class="line">Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?</p><p class="line">Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke,</p><p class="line">From which even here I slip my weary neck,</p><p class="line">And leave the burthen of it all on thee.</p><p class="line">Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:</p><p class="line">These English woes will make me smile in France.</p><p class="player">QUEEN ELIZABETH</p><p class="line">O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,</p><p class="line">And teach me how to curse mine enemies!</p><p class="player">QUEEN MARGARET</p><p class="line">Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days,</p><p class="line">Compare dead happiness with living woe,</p><p class="line">Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,</p><p class="line">And he that slew them fouler than he is:</p><p
