Before LEONATO'S house.</p><p class="line">Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a Messenger</p><p class="player">LEONATO</p><p class="line">I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon</p><p class="line">comes this night to Messina.</p><p class="player">Messenger</p><p class="line">He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off</p><p class="line">when I left him.</p><p class="player">LEONATO</p><p class="line">How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?</p><p class="player">Messenger</p><p class="line">But few of any sort, and none of name.</p><p class="player">LEONATO</p><p class="line">A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings</p><p class="line">home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath</p><p class="line">bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.</p><p class="player">Messenger</p><p class="line">Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by</p><p class="line">Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the</p><p class="line">promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,</p><p class="line">the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better</p><p class="line">bettered expectation than you must expect of me to</p><p class="line">tell you how.</p><p class="player">LEONATO</p><p class="line">He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much</p><p class="line">glad of it.</p><p class="player">Messenger</p><p class="line">I have already delivered him letters, and there</p><p class="line">appears much joy in him, even so much that joy could</p><p class="line">not show itself modest enough without a badge of</p><p class="line">bitterness.</p><p class="player">LEONATO</p><p class="line">Did he break out into tears?</p><p class="player">Messenger</p><p class="line">In great measure.</p><p class="player">LEONATO</p><p class="line">A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces</p><p class="line">truer than those that are so washed. How much</p><p class="line">better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!</p><p class="player">BEATRICE</p><p class="line">I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the</p><p class="line">wars or no?</p><p class="player">Messenger</p><p class="line">I know none of that name, lady: there was none such</p><p class="line">in the army of any sort.</p><p class="player">LEONATO</p><p class="line">What is he that you ask for, niece?</p><p class="player">HERO</p><p class="line">My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.</p><p class="player">Messenger</p><p class="line">O, he's returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.</p><p class="player">BEATRICE</p><p class="line">He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged</p><p class="line">Cupid at the flight, and my uncle's fool, reading</p><p class="line">the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged</p><p class="line">him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he</p><p class="line">killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath</p><p class="line">he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.</p><p class="player">LEONATO</p><p class="line">Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much,</p><p class="line">but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.</p><p class="player">Messenger</p><p class="line">He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.</p><p class="player">BEATRICE</p><p class="line">You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:</p><p class="line">he is a very valiant trencherman, he hath an</p><p class="line">excellent stomach.</p><p class="player">Messenger</p><p class="line">And a good soldier too, lady.</p><p class="player">BEATRICE</p><p class="line">And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?</p><p class="player">Messenger</p><p class="line">A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed with all</p><p class="line">honourable virtues.</p><p class="player">BEATRICE</p><p class="line">It is so, indeed, he is no less than a stuffed man:</p><p class="line">but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.</p><p class="player">LEONATO</p><p class="line">You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a</p><p class="line">kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:</p><p class="line">they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit</p><p class="line">between them.</p><p class="player">BEATRICE</p><p class="line">Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last</p><p class="line">conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and</p><p class="line">now is the whole man governed with one: so that if</p><p class="line">he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him</p><p class="line">bear it for a difference between himself and his</p><p class="line">horse, for it is all the wealth that he hath left,</p><p class="line">to be known a reasonable creature.

But, I pray</p><p class="line">you, who is his companion? Is there no young</p><p class="line">squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?</p><p class="player">Messenger</p><p class="line">He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.</p><p class="player">BEATRICE</p><p class="line">O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he</p><p class="line">is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker</p><p class="line">runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if</p><p class="line">he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a</p><p class="line">thousand pound ere a' be cured.</p><p class="player">Messenger</p><p class="line">I will hold friends with you, lady.</p><p class="player">BEATRICE</p><p class="line">Do, good friend.</p><p class="player">LEONATO</p><p class="line">You will never run mad, niece.</p><p class="player">BEATRICE</p><p class="line">No, not till a hot January.</p><p class="player">Messenger</p><p class="line">Don Pedro is approached.</p><p class="line">Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASAR</p><p class="player">DON PEDRO</p><p class="line">Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your</p><p class="line">trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid</p><p class="line">cost, and you encounter it.</p><p class="player">LEONATO</p><p class="line">Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of</p><p class="line">your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should</p><p class="line">remain, but when you depart from me, sorrow abides</p><p class="line">and happiness takes his leave.</p><p class="player">DON PEDRO</p><p class="line">You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this</p><p class="line">is your daughter.</p><p class="player">LEONATO</p><p class="line">Her mother hath many times told me so.</p><p class="player">BENEDICK</p><p class="line">Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?</p><p class="player">LEONATO</p><p class="line">Signior Benedick, no, for then were you a child.</p><p class="player">DON PEDRO</p><p class="line">You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this</p><p class="line">what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers</p><p class="line">herself.

I thank God</p><p class="line">and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I</p><p class="line">had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man</p><p class="line">swear he loves me.</p><p class="player">BENEDICK</p><p class="line">God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some</p><p class="line">gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate</p><p class="line">scratched face.</p><p class="player">BEATRICE</p><p class="line">Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such</p><p class="line">a face as yours were.</p><p class="player">BENEDICK</p><p class="line">Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.</p><p class="player">BEATRICE</p><p class="line">A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.</p><p class="player">BENEDICK</p><p class="line">I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and</p><p class="line">so good a continuer.

I dare swear he is no</p><p class="line">hypocrite, but prays from his heart.</p><p class="player">LEONATO</p><p class="line">If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.</p><p class="line">To DON JOHN</p><p class="line">Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to</p><p class="line">the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.</p><p class="player">DON JOHN</p><p class="line">I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank</p><p class="line">you.</p><p class="player">LEONATO</p><p class="line">Please it your grace lead on?</p><p class="player">DON PEDRO</p><p class="line">Your hand, Leonato, we will go together.</p><p class="line">Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO</p><p class="player">CLAUDIO</p><p class="line">Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?</p><p class="player">BENEDICK</p><p class="line">I noted her not, but I looked on her.</p><p class="player">CLAUDIO</p><p class="line">Is she not a modest young lady?</p><p class="player">BENEDICK</p><p class="line">Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for</p><p class="line">my simple true judgment, or would you have me speak</p><p class="line">after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?</p><p class="player">CLAUDIO</p><p class="line">No, I pray thee speak in sober judgment.</p><p class="player">BENEDICK</p><p class="line">Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high</p><p class="line">praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little</p><p class="line">for a great praise: only this commendation I can</p><p class="line">afford her, that were she other than she is, she</p><p class="line">were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I</p><p class="line">do not like her.</p><p class="player">CLAUDIO</p><p class="line">Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me</p><p class="line">truly how thou likest her.</p><p class="player">BENEDICK</p><p class="line">Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?</p><p class="player">CLAUDIO</p><p class="line">Can the world buy such a jewel?</p><p class="player">BENEDICK</p><p class="line">Yea, and a case to put it into.

I have known when there was no music</p><p class="line">with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he</p><p class="line">rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known</p><p class="line">when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a</p><p class="line">good armour, and now will he lie ten nights awake,</p><p class="line">carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to</p><p class="line">speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man</p><p class="line">and a soldier, and now is he turned orthography, his</p><p class="line">words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many</p><p class="line">strange dishes.

Love me!</p><p class="line">why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:</p><p class="line">they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive</p><p class="line">the love come from her, they say too that she will</p><p class="line">rather die than give any sign of affection. I did</p><p class="line">never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy</p><p class="line">are they that hear their detractions and can put</p><p class="line">them to mending. They say the lady is fair, 'tis a</p><p class="line">truth, I can bear them witness, and virtuous, 'tis</p><p class="line">so, I cannot reprove it, and wise, but for loving</p><p class="line">me, by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor</p><p class="line">no great argument of her folly, for I will be</p><p class="line">horribly in love with her. I may chance have some</p><p class="line">odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,</p><p class="line">because I have railed so long against marriage: but</p><p class="line">doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat</p><p class="line">in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.</p><p class="line">Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of</p><p class="line">the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?</p><p class="line">No, the world must be peopled.
