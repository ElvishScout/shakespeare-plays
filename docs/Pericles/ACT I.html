Peace to the lords of Tyre!</p><p class="player">HELICANUS</p><p class="line">Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.</p><p class="player">THALIARD</p><p class="line">From him I come</p><p class="line">With message unto princely Pericles,</p><p class="line">But since my landing I have understood</p><p class="line">Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,</p><p class="line">My message must return from whence it came.</p><p class="player">HELICANUS</p><p class="line">We have no reason to desire it,</p><p class="line">Commended to our master, not to us:</p><p class="line">Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,</p><p class="line">As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.</p><p class="action">Exeunt</p><p id="5" class="scene-title">SCENE IV. Tarsus. A room in the Governor's house.</p><p class="action">Enter CLEON, the governor of Tarsus, with DIONYZA, and others</p><p class="player">CLEON</p><p class="line">My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,</p><p class="line">And by relating tales of others' griefs,</p><p class="line">See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?</p><p class="player">DIONYZA</p><p class="line">That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it,</p><p class="line">For who digs hills because they do aspire</p><p class="line">Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.</p><p class="line">O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are,</p><p class="line">Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,</p><p class="line">But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.</p><p class="player">CLEON</p><p class="line">O Dionyza,</p><p class="line">Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,</p><p class="line">Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?</p><p class="line">Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep</p><p class="line">Our woes into the air, our eyes do weep,</p><p class="line">Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder,</p><p class="line">That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,</p><p class="line">They may awake their helps to comfort them.</p><p class="line">I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,</p><p class="line">And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.</p><p class="player">DIONYZA</p><p class="line">I'll do my best, sir.</p><p class="player">CLEON</p><p class="line">This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,</p><p class="line">A city on whom plenty held full hand,</p><p class="line">For riches strew'd herself even in the streets,</p><p class="line">Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,</p><p class="line">And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at,</p><p class="line">Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,</p><p class="line">Like one another's glass to trim them by:</p><p class="line">Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,</p><p class="line">And not so much to feed on as delight,</p><p class="line">All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,</p><p class="line">The name of help grew odious to repeat.</p><p class="player">DIONYZA</p><p class="line">O, 'tis too true.</p><p class="player">CLEON</p><p class="line">But see what heaven can do! By this our change,</p><p class="line">These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,</p><p class="line">Were all too little to content and please,</p><p class="line">Although they gave their creatures in abundance,</p><p class="line">As houses are defiled for want of use,</p><p class="line">They are now starved for want of exercise:</p><p class="line">Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,</p><p class="line">Must have inventions to delight the taste,</p><p class="line">Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:</p><p class="line">Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,</p><p class="line">Thought nought too curious, are ready now</p><p class="line">To eat those little darlings whom they loved.</p><p class="line">So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife</p><p class="line">Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:</p><p class="line">Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping,</p><p class="line">Here many sink, yet those which see them fall</p><p class="line">Have scarce strength left to give them burial.</p><p class="line">Is not this true?</p><p class="player">DIONYZA</p><p class="line">Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.</p><p class="player">CLEON</p><p class="line">O, let those cities that of plenty's cup</p><p class="line">And her prosperities so largely taste,</p><p class="line">With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!</p><p class="line">The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.</p><p class="action">Enter a Lord</p><p class="player">Lord</p><p class="line">Where's the lord governor?</p><p class="player">CLEON</p><p class="line">Here.</p><p class="line">Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,</p><p class="line">For comfort is too far for us to expect.</p><p class="player">Lord</p><p class="line">We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore,</p><p class="line">A portly sail of ships make hitherward.</p><p class="player">CLEON</p><p class="line">I thought as much.</p><p class="line">One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,</p><p class="line">That may succeed as his inheritor,</p><p class="line">And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,</p><p class="line">Taking advantage of our misery,</p><p class="line">Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,</p><p class="line">To beat us down, the which are down already,</p><p class="line">And make a conquest of unhappy me,</p><p class="line">Whereas no glory's got to overcome.</p><p class="player">Lord</p><p class="line">That's the least fear, for, by the semblance</p><p class="line">Of their white flags display'd, they bring us peace,</p><p class="line">And come to us as favourers, not as foes.</p><p class="player">CLEON</p><p class="line">Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:</p><p class="line">Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.</p><p class="line">But bring they what they will and what they can,</p><p class="line">What need we fear?</p><p class="line">The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.</p><p class="line">Go tell their general we attend him here,</p><p class="line">To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,</p><p class="line">And what he craves.</p><p class="player">Lord</p><p class="line">I go, my lord.</p><p class="action">Exit</p><p class="player">CLEON</p><p class="line">Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist,</p><p class="line">If wars, we are unable to resist.</p><p class="action">Enter PERICLES with Attendants</p><p class="player">PERICLES</p><p class="line">Lord governor, for so we hear you are,</p><p class="line">Let not our ships and number of our men</p><p class="line">Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes.</p><p class="line">We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,</p><p class="line">And seen the desolation of your streets:</p><p class="line">Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,</p><p class="line">But to relieve them of their heavy load,</p><p class="line">And these our ships, you happily may think</p><p class="line">Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within</p><p class="line">With bloody veins, expecting overthrow,</p><p class="line">Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,</p><p class="line">And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.</p><p class="player">All</p><p class="line">The gods of Greece protect you!</p><p class="line">And we'll pray for you.</p><p class="player">PERICLES</p><p class="line">Arise, I pray you, rise:</p><p class="line">We do not look for reverence, but to love,</p><p class="line">And harbourage for ourself, our ships, and men.</p><p class="player">CLEON</p><p class="line">The which when any shall not gratify,</p><p class="line">Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,</p><p class="line">Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,</p><p class="line">The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!</p><p class="line">Till when,--the which I hope shall ne'er be seen,--</p><p class="line">Your grace is welcome to our town and us.</p><p class="player">PERICLES</p><p class="line">Which welcome we'll accept, feast here awhile,</p><p class="line">Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.</p><p class="action">Exeunt</p></body></html>
