How goes it now, sir? this news</p><p class="line">which is called true is so like an old tale, that</p><p class="line">the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king</p><p class="line">found his heir?</p><p class="player">Third Gentleman</p><p class="line">Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by</p><p class="line">circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you</p><p class="line">see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle</p><p class="line">of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,</p><p class="line">the letters of Antigonus found with it which they</p><p class="line">know to be his character, the majesty of the</p><p class="line">creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection</p><p class="line">of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,</p><p class="line">and many other evidences proclaim her with all</p><p class="line">certainty to be the king's daughter.

There was casting up of eyes,</p><p class="line">holding up of hands, with countenances of such</p><p class="line">distraction that they were to be known by garment,</p><p class="line">not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of</p><p class="line">himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that</p><p class="line">joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,</p><p class="line">thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness, then</p><p class="line">embraces his son-in-law, then again worries he his</p><p class="line">daughter with clipping her, now he thanks the old</p><p class="line">shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten</p><p class="line">conduit of many kings' reigns.
