We must to the king and show</p><p class="line">our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your</p><p class="line">daughter nor my sister, we are gone else. Sir, I</p><p class="line">will give you as much as this old man does when the</p><p class="line">business is performed, and remain, as he says, your</p><p class="line">pawn till it be brought you.</p><p class="player">AUTOLYCUS</p><p class="line">I will trust you.
