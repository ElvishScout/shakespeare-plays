How goes it now, sir? this news</p><p class="line">which is called true is so like an old tale, that</p><p class="line">the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king</p><p class="line">found his heir?</p><p class="player">Third Gentleman</p><p class="line">Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by</p><p class="line">circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you</p><p class="line">see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle</p><p class="line">of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,</p><p class="line">the letters of Antigonus found with it which they</p><p class="line">know to be his character, the majesty of the</p><p class="line">creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection</p><p class="line">of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,</p><p class="line">and many other evidences proclaim her with all</p><p class="line">certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see</p><p class="line">the meeting of the two kings?</p><p class="player">Second Gentleman</p><p class="line">No.</p><p class="player">Third Gentleman</p><p class="line">Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,</p><p class="line">cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one</p><p class="line">joy crown another, so and in such manner that it</p><p class="line">seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their</p><p class="line">joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,</p><p class="line">holding up of hands, with countenances of such</p><p class="line">distraction that they were to be known by garment,</p><p class="line">not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of</p><p class="line">himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that</p><p class="line">joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,</p><p class="line">thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness, then</p><p class="line">embraces his son-in-law, then again worries he his</p><p class="line">daughter with clipping her, now he thanks the old</p><p class="line">shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten</p><p class="line">conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such</p><p class="line">another encounter, which lames report to follow it</p><p class="line">and undoes description to do it.</p><p class="player">Second Gentleman</p><p class="line">What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried</p><p class="line">hence the child?</p><p class="player">Third Gentleman</p><p class="line">Like an old tale still, which will have matter to</p><p class="line">rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear</p><p class="line">open.

But O, the noble</p><p class="line">combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in</p><p class="line">Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of</p><p class="line">her husband, another elevated that the oracle was</p><p class="line">fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,</p><p class="line">and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin</p><p class="line">her to her heart that she might no more be in danger</p><p class="line">of losing.</p><p class="player">First Gentleman</p><p class="line">The dignity of this act was worth the audience of</p><p class="line">kings and princes, for by such was it acted.</p><p class="player">Third Gentleman</p><p class="line">One of the prettiest touches of all and that which</p><p class="line">angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not</p><p class="line">the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's</p><p class="line">death, with the manner how she came to't bravely</p><p class="line">confessed and lamented by the king, how</p><p class="line">attentiveness wounded his daughter, till, from one</p><p class="line">sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'</p><p class="line">I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my</p><p class="line">heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed</p><p class="line">colour, some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world</p><p class="line">could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.</p><p class="player">First Gentleman</p><p class="line">Are they returned to the court?</p><p class="player">Third Gentleman</p><p class="line">No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,</p><p class="line">which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many</p><p class="line">years in doing and now newly performed by that rare</p><p class="line">Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself</p><p class="line">eternity and could put breath into his work, would</p><p class="line">beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her</p><p class="line">ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that</p><p class="line">they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of</p><p class="line">answer: thither with all greediness of affection</p><p class="line">are they gone, and there they intend to sup.</p><p class="player">Second Gentleman</p><p class="line">I thought she had some great matter there in hand,</p><p class="line">for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever</p><p class="line">since the death of Hermione, visited that removed</p><p class="line">house. Shall we thither and with our company piece</p><p class="line">the rejoicing?</p><p class="player">First Gentleman</p><p class="line">Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?</p><p class="line">every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:</p><p class="line">our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.</p><p class="line">Let's along.</p><p class="line">Exeunt Gentlemen</p><p class="player">AUTOLYCUS</p><p class="line">Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,</p><p class="line">would preferment drop on my head.
