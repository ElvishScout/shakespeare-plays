O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!</p><p class="line">sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em, now the</p><p class="line">ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon</p><p class="line">swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a</p><p class="line">cork into a hogshead. And then for the</p><p class="line">land-service, to see how the bear tore out his</p><p class="line">shoulder-bone, how he cried to me for help and said</p><p class="line">his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an</p><p class="line">end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned</p><p class="line">it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the</p><p class="line">sea mocked them, and how the poor gentleman roared</p><p class="line">and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than</p><p class="line">the sea or weather.</p><p class="player">Shepherd</p><p class="line">Name of mercy, when was this, boy?</p><p class="player">Clown</p><p class="line">Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these</p><p class="line">sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor</p><p class="line">the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it</p><p class="line">now.</p><p class="player">Shepherd</p><p class="line">Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!</p><p class="player">Clown</p><p class="line">I would you had been by the ship side, to have</p><p class="line">helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.</p><p class="player">Shepherd</p><p class="line">Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,</p><p class="line">boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things</p><p class="line">dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for</p><p class="line">thee, look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's</p><p class="line">child! look thee here, take up, take up, boy,</p><p class="line">open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be</p><p class="line">rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:</p><p class="line">open't. What's within, boy?</p><p class="player">Clown</p><p class="line">You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth</p><p class="line">are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!</p><p class="player">Shepherd</p><p class="line">This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up</p><p class="line">with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.</p><p class="line">We are lucky, boy, and to be so still requires</p><p class="line">nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good</p><p class="line">boy, the next way home.</p><p class="player">Clown</p><p class="line">Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see</p><p class="line">if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much</p><p class="line">he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they</p><p class="line">are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury</p><p class="line">it.</p><p class="player">Shepherd</p><p class="line">That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that</p><p class="line">which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the</p><p class="line">sight of him.</p><p class="player">Clown</p><p class="line">Marry, will I, and you shall help to put him i' the ground.</p><p class="player">Shepherd</p><p class="line">'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.</p><p class="action">Exeunt</p></body></html>
