As, for proof, now: a purse of gold</p><p class="line">most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most</p><p class="line">dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning, got with</p><p class="line">swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in,'</p><p class="line">now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder</p><p class="line">and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.</p><p class="player">FALSTAFF</p><p class="line">By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad.

An old</p><p class="line">lord of the council rated me the other day in the</p><p class="line">street about you, sir, but I marked him not, and yet</p><p class="line">he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not, and</p><p class="line">yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.</p><p class="player">PRINCE HENRY</p><p class="line">Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the</p><p class="line">streets, and no man regards it.</p><p class="player">FALSTAFF</p><p class="line">O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able</p><p class="line">to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon</p><p class="line">me, Hal, God forgive thee for it! Before I knew</p><p class="line">thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man</p><p class="line">should speak truly, little better than one of the</p><p class="line">wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give</p><p class="line">it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:</p><p class="line">I'll be damned for never a king's son in</p><p class="line">Christendom.</p><p class="player">PRINCE HENRY</p><p class="line">Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?</p><p class="player">FALSTAFF</p><p class="line">'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad, I'll make one, an I</p><p class="line">do not, call me villain and baffle me.</p><p class="player">PRINCE HENRY</p><p class="line">I see a good amendment of life in thee, from praying</p><p class="line">to purse-taking.</p><p class="player">FALSTAFF</p><p class="line">Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal, 'tis no sin for a</p><p class="line">man to labour in his vocation.</p><p class="line">Enter POINS</p><p class="line">Poins!
