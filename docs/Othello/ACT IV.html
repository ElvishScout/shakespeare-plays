O, these men, these men!</p><p class="line">Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--</p><p class="line">That there be women do abuse their husbands</p><p class="line">In such gross kind?</p><p class="player">EMILIA</p><p class="line">There be some such, no question.</p><p class="player">DESDEMONA</p><p class="line">Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?</p><p class="player">EMILIA</p><p class="line">Why, would not you?</p><p class="player">DESDEMONA</p><p class="line">No, by this heavenly light!</p><p class="player">EMILIA</p><p class="line">Nor I neither by this heavenly light,</p><p class="line">I might do't as well i' the dark.</p><p class="player">DESDEMONA</p><p class="line">Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?</p><p class="player">EMILIA</p><p class="line">The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.</p><p class="line">For a small vice.</p><p class="player">DESDEMONA</p><p class="line">In troth, I think thou wouldst not.</p><p class="player">EMILIA</p><p class="line">In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had</p><p class="line">done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a</p><p class="line">joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for</p><p class="line">gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty</p><p class="line">exhibition, but for the whole world,--why, who would</p><p class="line">not make her husband a cuckold to make him a</p><p class="line">monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.</p><p class="player">DESDEMONA</p><p class="line">Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong</p><p class="line">For the whole world.</p><p class="player">EMILIA</p><p class="line">Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and</p><p class="line">having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your</p><p class="line">own world, and you might quickly make it right.</p><p class="player">DESDEMONA</p><p class="line">I do not think there is any such woman.</p><p class="player">EMILIA</p><p class="line">Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage as would</p><p class="line">store the world they played for.</p><p class="line">But I do think it is their husbands' faults</p><p class="line">If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,</p><p class="line">And pour our treasures into foreign laps,</p><p class="line">Or else break out in peevish jealousies,</p><p class="line">Throwing restraint upon us, or say they strike us,</p><p class="line">Or scant our former having in despite,</p><p class="line">Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,</p><p class="line">Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know</p><p class="line">Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell</p><p class="line">And have their palates both for sweet and sour,</p><p class="line">As husbands have. What is it that they do</p><p class="line">When they change us for others?
