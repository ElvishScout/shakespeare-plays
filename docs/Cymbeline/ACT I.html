A lady</p><p class="line">So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,</p><p class="line">Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'd</p><p class="line">With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition</p><p class="line">Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures</p><p class="line">That play with all infirmities for gold</p><p class="line">Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff</p><p class="line">As well might poison poison! Be revenged,</p><p class="line">Or she that bore you was no queen, and you</p><p class="line">Recoil from your great stock.</p><p class="player">IMOGEN</p><p class="line">Revenged!</p><p class="line">How should I be revenged? If this be true,--</p><p class="line">As I have such a heart that both mine ears</p><p class="line">Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,</p><p class="line">How should I be revenged?</p><p class="player">IACHIMO</p><p class="line">Should he make me</p><p class="line">Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,</p><p class="line">Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,</p><p class="line">In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.</p><p class="line">I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,</p><p class="line">More noble than that runagate to your bed,</p><p class="line">And will continue fast to your affection,</p><p class="line">Still close as sure.</p><p class="player">IMOGEN</p><p class="line">What, ho, Pisanio!</p><p class="player">IACHIMO</p><p class="line">Let me my service tender on your lips.</p><p class="player">IMOGEN</p><p class="line">Away! I do condemn mine ears that have</p><p class="line">So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,</p><p class="line">Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not</p><p class="line">For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.</p><p class="line">Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far</p><p class="line">From thy report as thou from honour, and</p><p class="line">Solicit'st here a lady that disdains</p><p class="line">Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!</p><p class="line">The king my father shall be made acquainted</p><p class="line">Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,</p><p class="line">A saucy stranger in his court to mart</p><p class="line">As in a Romish stew and to expound</p><p class="line">His beastly mind to us, he hath a court</p><p class="line">He little cares for and a daughter who</p><p class="line">He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!</p><p class="player">IACHIMO</p><p class="line">O happy Leonatus! I may say</p><p class="line">The credit that thy lady hath of thee</p><p class="line">Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness</p><p class="line">Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!</p><p class="line">A lady to the worthiest sir that ever</p><p class="line">Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only</p><p class="line">For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.</p><p class="line">I have spoke this, to know if your affiance</p><p class="line">Were deeply rooted, and shall make your lord,</p><p class="line">That which he is, new o'er: and he is one</p><p class="line">The truest manner'd, such a holy witch</p><p class="line">That he enchants societies into him,</p><p class="line">Half all men's hearts are his.</p><p class="player">IMOGEN</p><p class="line">You make amends.</p><p class="player">IACHIMO</p><p class="line">He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:</p><p class="line">He hath a kind of honour sets him off,</p><p class="line">More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,</p><p class="line">Most mighty princess, that I have adventured</p><p class="line">To try your taking a false report, which hath</p><p class="line">Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment</p><p class="line">In the election of a sir so rare,</p><p class="line">Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him</p><p class="line">Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,</p><p class="line">Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.</p><p class="player">IMOGEN</p><p class="line">All's well, sir: take my power i' the court</p><p class="line">for yours.</p><p class="player">IACHIMO</p><p class="line">My humble thanks. I had almost forgot</p><p class="line">To entreat your grace but in a small request,</p><p class="line">And yet of moment to, for it concerns</p><p class="line">Your lord, myself and other noble friends,</p><p class="line">Are partners in the business.</p><p class="player">IMOGEN</p><p class="line">Pray, what is't?</p><p class="player">IACHIMO</p><p class="line">Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--</p><p class="line">The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums</p><p class="line">To buy a present for the emperor</p><p class="line">Which I, the factor for the rest, have done</p><p class="line">In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels</p><p class="line">Of rich and exquisite form, their values great,</p><p class="line">And I am something curious, being strange,</p><p class="line">To have them in safe stowage: may it please you</p><p class="line">To take them in protection?</p><p class="player">IMOGEN</p><p class="line">Willingly,</p><p class="line">And pawn mine honour for their safety: since</p><p class="line">My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them</p><p class="line">In my bedchamber.</p><p class="player">IACHIMO</p><p class="line">They are in a trunk,</p><p class="line">Attended by my men: I will make bold</p><p class="line">To send them to you, only for this night,</p><p class="line">I must aboard to-morrow.</p><p class="player">IMOGEN</p><p class="line">O, no, no.</p><p class="player">IACHIMO</p><p class="line">Yes, I beseech, or I shall short my word</p><p class="line">By lengthening my return.
