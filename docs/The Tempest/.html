Let me not,</p><p class="line">Since I have my dukedom got</p><p class="line">And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell</p><p class="line">In this bare island by your spell,</p><p class="line">But release me from my bands</p><p class="line">With the help of your good hands:</p><p class="line">Gentle breath of yours my sails</p><p class="line">Must fill, or else my project fails,</p><p class="line">Which was to please. Now I want</p><p class="line">Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,</p><p class="line">And my ending is despair,</p><p class="line">Unless I be relieved by prayer,</p><p class="line">Which pierces so that it assaults</p><p class="line">Mercy itself and frees all faults.</p><p class="line">As you from crimes would pardon'd be,</p><p class="line">Let your indulgence set me free.</p></body></html>
