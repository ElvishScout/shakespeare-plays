KING RICHARD II's palace.</p><p class="line">Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other Nobles and Attendants</p><p class="player">KING RICHARD II</p><p class="line">Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,</p><p class="line">Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,</p><p class="line">Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,</p><p class="line">Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,</p><p class="line">Which then our leisure would not let us hear,</p><p class="line">Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</p><p class="player">JOHN OF GAUNT</p><p class="line">I have, my liege.</p><p class="player">KING RICHARD II</p><p class="line">Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,</p><p class="line">If he appeal the duke on ancient malice,</p><p class="line">Or worthily, as a good subject should,</p><p class="line">On some known ground of treachery in him?</p><p class="player">JOHN OF GAUNT</p><p class="line">As near as I could sift him on that argument,</p><p class="line">On some apparent danger seen in him</p><p class="line">Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.</p><p class="player">KING RICHARD II</p><p class="line">Then call them to our presence, face to face,</p><p class="line">And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear</p><p class="line">The accuser and the accused freely speak:</p><p class="line">High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,</p><p class="line">In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.</p><p class="line">Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY</p><p class="player">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</p><p class="line">Many years of happy days befal</p><p class="line">My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!</p><p class="player">THOMAS MOWBRAY</p><p class="line">Each day still better other's

both: yet one but flatters us,</p><p class="line">As well appeareth by the cause you come,</p><p class="line">Namely to appeal each other of high treason.</p><p class="line">Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object</p><p class="line">Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</p><p class="player">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</p><p class="line">First, heaven be the record to my speech!</p><p class="line">In the devotion of a subject's love,</p><p class="line">Tendering the precious safety of my prince,</p><p class="line">And free from other misbegotten hate,</p><p class="line">Come I appellant to this princely presence.</p><p class="line">Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,</p><p class="line">And mark my greeting well, for what I speak</p><p class="line">My body shall make good upon this earth,</p><p class="line">Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.</p><p class="line">Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,</p><p class="line">Too good to be so and too bad to live,</p><p class="line">Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,</p><p class="line">The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.</p><p class="line">Once more, the more to aggravate the note,</p><p class="line">With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat,</p><p class="line">And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,</p><p class="line">What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.</p><p class="player">THOMAS MOWBRAY</p><p class="line">Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:</p><p class="line">'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,</p><p class="line">The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,</p><p class="line">Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain,</p><p class="line">The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:</p><p class="line">Yet can I not of such tame patience boast</p><p class="line">As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:</p><p class="line">First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me</p><p class="line">From giving reins and spurs to my free speech,</p><p class="line">Which else would post until it had return'd</p><p class="line">These terms of treason doubled down his throat.</p><p class="line">Setting aside his high blood's royalty,</p><p class="line">And let him be no kinsman to my liege,</p><p class="line">I do defy him, and I spit at him,</p><p class="line">Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:</p><p class="line">Which to maintain I would allow him odds,</p><p class="line">And meet him, were I tied to run afoot</p><p class="line">Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,</p><p class="line">Or any other ground inhabitable,</p><p class="line">Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.</p><p class="line">Mean time let this defend my loyalty,</p><p class="line">By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.</p><p class="player">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</p><p class="line">Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,</p><p class="line">Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,</p><p class="line">And lay aside my high blood's royalty,</p><p class="line">Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.</p><p class="line">If guilty dread have left thee so much strength</p><p class="line">As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:</p><p class="line">By that and all the rites of knighthood else,</p><p class="line">Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,</p><p class="line">What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.</p><p class="player">THOMAS MOWBRAY</p><p class="line">I take it up, and by that sword I swear</p><p class="line">Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,</p><p class="line">I'll answer thee in any fair degree,</p><p class="line">Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:</p><p class="line">And when I mount, alive may I not light,</p><p class="line">If I be traitor or unjustly fight!</p><p class="player">KING RICHARD II</p><p class="line">What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?</p><p class="line">It must be great that can inherit us</p><p class="line">So much as of a thought of ill in him.</p><p class="player">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</p><p class="line">Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true,</p><p class="line">That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles</p><p class="line">In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,</p><p class="line">The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,</p><p class="line">Like a false traitor and injurious villain.</p><p class="line">Besides I say and will in battle prove,</p><p class="line">Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge</p><p class="line">That ever was survey'd by English eye,</p><p class="line">That all the treasons for these eighteen years</p><p class="line">Complotted and contrived in this land</p><p class="line">Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.</p><p class="line">Further I say and further will maintain</p><p class="line">Upon his bad life to make all this good,</p><p class="line">That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,</p><p class="line">Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,</p><p class="line">And consequently, like a traitor coward,</p><p class="line">Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:</p><p class="line">Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,</p><p class="line">Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,</p><p class="line">To me for justice and rough chastisement,</p><p class="line">And, by the glorious worth of my descent,</p><p class="line">This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</p><p class="player">KING RICHARD II</p><p class="line">How high a pitch his resolution soars!</p><p class="line">Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?</p><p class="player">THOMAS MOWBRAY</p><p class="line">O, let my sovereign turn away his face</p><p class="line">And bid his ears a little while be deaf,</p><p class="line">Till I have told this slander of his blood,</p><p class="line">How God and good men hate so foul a liar.</p><p class="player">KING RICHARD II</p><p class="line">Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:</p><p class="line">Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,</p><p class="line">As he is but my father's brother's son,</p><p class="line">Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,</p><p class="line">Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood</p><p class="line">Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize</p><p

class="player">THOMAS MOWBRAY</p><p class="line">Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,</p><p class="line">Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.</p><p class="line">Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais</p><p class="line">Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers,</p><p class="line">The other part reserved I by consent,</p><p class="line">For that my sovereign liege was in my debt</p><p class="line">Upon remainder of a dear account,</p><p class="line">Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:</p><p class="line">Now swallow down that lie.
