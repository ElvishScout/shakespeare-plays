class="line">Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,</p><p class="line">And consequently, like a traitor coward,</p><p class="line">Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:</p><p class="line">Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,</p><p class="line">Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,</p><p class="line">To me for justice and rough chastisement,</p><p
