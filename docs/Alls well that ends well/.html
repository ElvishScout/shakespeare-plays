Would, for the</p><p class="line">king's sake, he were living!

I have those hopes of her good that</p><p class="line">her education promises, her dispositions she</p><p class="line">inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer, for where</p><p class="line">an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there</p><p class="line">commendations go with pity, they are virtues and</p><p class="line">traitors too, in her they are the better for their</p><p class="line">simpleness, she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.</p><p class="player">LAFEU</p><p class="line">Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.</p><p class="player">COUNTESS</p><p class="line">'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise</p><p class="line">in.

Love all, trust a few,</p><p class="line">Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy</p><p class="line">Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend</p><p class="line">Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,</p><p class="line">But never tax'd for speech.

I think not on my father,</p><p class="line">And these great tears grace his remembrance more</p><p class="line">Than those I shed for him. What was he like?</p><p class="line">I have forgot him: my imagination</p><p class="line">Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.</p><p class="line">I am undone: there is no living, none,</p><p class="line">If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one</p><p class="line">That I should love a bright particular star</p><p class="line">And think to wed it, he is so above me:</p><p class="line">In his bright radiance and collateral light</p><p class="line">Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.</p><p class="line">The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:</p><p class="line">The hind that would be mated by the lion</p><p class="line">Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,</p><p class="line">To see him every hour, to sit and draw</p><p class="line">His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,</p><p class="line">In our heart's table, heart too capable</p><p class="line">Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:</p><p class="line">But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy</p><p class="line">Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?</p><p class="line">Enter PAROLLES</p><p class="line">Aside</p><p class="line">One that goes with him: I love him for his sake,</p><p class="line">And yet I know him a notorious liar,</p><p class="line">Think him a great way fool, solely a coward,</p><p class="line">Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,</p><p class="line">That they take place, when virtue's steely bones</p><p class="line">Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see</p><p class="line">Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.</p><p class="player">PAROLLES</p><p class="line">Save you, fair queen!</p><p class="player">HELENA</p><p class="line">And you, monarch!</p><p class="player">PAROLLES</p><p class="line">No.</p><p class="player">HELENA</p><p class="line">And no.</p><p class="player">PAROLLES</p><p class="line">Are you meditating on virginity?</p><p class="player">HELENA</p><p class="line">Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me</p><p class="line">ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity, how</p><p class="line">may we barricado it against him?</p><p class="player">PAROLLES</p><p class="line">Keep him out.</p><p class="player">HELENA</p><p class="line">But he assails, and our virginity, though valiant,</p><p class="line">in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some</p><p class="line">warlike resistance.</p><p class="player">PAROLLES</p><p class="line">There is none: man, sitting down before you, will</p><p class="line">undermine you and blow you up.</p><p class="player">HELENA</p><p class="line">Bless our poor virginity from underminers and</p><p class="line">blowers up! Is there no military policy, how</p><p class="line">virgins might blow up men?</p><p class="player">PAROLLES</p><p class="line">Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be</p><p class="line">blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with</p><p class="line">the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It</p><p class="line">is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to</p><p class="line">preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational</p><p class="line">increase and there was never virgin got till</p><p class="line">virginity was first lost. That you were made of is</p><p class="line">metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost</p><p class="line">may be ten times found, by being ever kept, it is</p><p class="line">ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion, away with 't!</p><p class="player">HELENA</p><p class="line">I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.</p><p class="player">PAROLLES</p><p class="line">There's little can be said in 't, 'tis against the</p><p class="line">rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,</p><p class="line">is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible</p><p class="line">disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:</p><p class="line">virginity murders itself and should be buried in</p><p class="line">highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate</p><p class="line">offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,</p><p class="line">much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very</p><p class="line">paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.</p><p class="line">Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of</p><p class="line">self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the</p><p class="line">canon. Keep it not, you cannot choose but loose</p><p class="line">by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make</p><p class="line">itself ten, which is a goodly increase, and the</p><p class="line">principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!</p><p class="player">HELENA</p><p class="line">How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?</p><p class="player">PAROLLES</p><p class="line">Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it</p><p class="line">likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with</p><p class="line">lying, the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't</p><p class="line">while 'tis vendible, answer the time of request.</p><p class="line">Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out</p><p class="line">of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just</p><p class="line">like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not</p><p class="line">now. Your date is better in your pie and your</p><p class="line">porridge than in your cheek, and your virginity,</p><p class="line">your old virginity, is like one of our French</p><p class="line">withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily, marry,</p><p class="line">'tis a withered pear, it was formerly better,</p><p class="line">marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?</p><p class="player">HELENA</p><p class="line">Not my virginity yet [         ]</p><p class="line">There shall your master have a thousand loves,</p><p class="line">A mother and a mistress and a friend,</p><p class="line">A phoenix, captain and an enemy,</p><p class="line">A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,</p><p class="line">A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear,</p><p class="line">His humble ambition, proud humility,</p><p class="line">His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,</p><p class="line">His faith, his sweet disaster, with a world</p><p class="line">Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,</p><p class="line">That blinking Cupid gossips.
