You have some stain of soldier in you: let me</p><p class="line">ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity, how</p><p class="line">may we barricado it against him?</p><p class="player">PAROLLES</p><p class="line">Keep him out.</p><p class="player">HELENA</p><p class="line">But he assails, and our virginity, though valiant,</p><p class="line">in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some</p><p class="line">warlike resistance.</p><p class="player">PAROLLES</p><p class="line">There is none: man, sitting down before you, will</p><p class="line">undermine you and blow you up.</p><p class="player">HELENA</p><p class="line">Bless our poor virginity from underminers and</p><p class="line">blowers up! Is there no military policy, how</p><p class="line">virgins might blow up men?</p><p class="player">PAROLLES</p><p class="line">Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be</p><p class="line">blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with</p><p class="line">the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It</p><p class="line">is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to</p><p class="line">preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational</p><p class="line">increase and there was never virgin got till</p><p class="line">virginity was first lost. That you were made of is</p><p class="line">metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost</p><p class="line">may be ten times found, by being ever kept, it is</p><p class="line">ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion, away with 't!</p><p class="player">HELENA</p><p class="line">I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.</p><p class="player">PAROLLES</p><p class="line">There's little can be said in 't, 'tis against the</p><p class="line">rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,</p><p class="line">is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible</p><p class="line">disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:</p><p class="line">virginity murders itself and should be buried in</p><p class="line">highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate</p><p class="line">offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,</p><p class="line">much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very</p><p class="line">paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.</p><p class="line">Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of</p><p class="line">self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the</p><p class="line">canon. Keep it not, you cannot choose but loose</p><p class="line">by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make</p><p class="line">itself ten, which is a goodly increase, and the</p><p class="line">principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!</p><p class="player">HELENA</p><p class="line">How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?</p><p class="player">PAROLLES</p><p class="line">Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it</p><p class="line">likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with</p><p class="line">lying, the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't</p><p class="line">while 'tis vendible, answer the time of request.</p><p class="line">Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out</p><p class="line">of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just</p><p class="line">like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not</p><p class="line">now. Your date is better in your pie and your</p><p class="line">porridge than in your cheek, and your virginity,</p><p class="line">your old virginity, is like one of our French</p><p class="line">withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily, marry,</p><p class="line">'tis a withered pear, it was formerly better,</p><p class="line">marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?</p><p class="player">HELENA</p><p class="line">Not my virginity yet [         ]</p><p class="line">There shall your master have a thousand loves,</p><p class="line">A mother and a mistress and a friend,</p><p class="line">A phoenix, captain and an enemy,</p><p class="line">A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,</p><p class="line">A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear,</p><p class="line">His humble ambition, proud humility,</p><p class="line">His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,</p><p class="line">His faith, his sweet disaster, with a world</p><p class="line">Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,</p><p class="line">That blinking Cupid gossips.
